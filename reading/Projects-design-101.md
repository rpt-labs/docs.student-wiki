## Design 101

### Typography

 * Avoid using #000 - pure black doesn't exist in nature. Use a slight grey like #222 or #333.
 * Utilize 50 - 80 characters per line for maximum readability.
 * A line height that is 150% of the font size is also big for readability.
 * Use a sans-serif font (e.g. Helvetica) for title/heading text and a serif font (e.g. Georgia) for body text. The eye likes contrast.
