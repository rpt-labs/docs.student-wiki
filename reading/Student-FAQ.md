### Community

#### <a name="community"></a>How can I make the most out of my Hack Reactor community?

During Hack Reactor:
- pairing
- get up walk around and talk to other students about how they approached a problem
- propagate knowledge to other students by holding 8pm sessions/workshops on something
- building community through social nights
- go out to meals with everyone
- get to know everyone: staff, students, and alumni

After Hack Reactor:
- help out with new technologies
- write books
- attend conferences
- help each other get jobs
- go to hackathons and work on side projects
- come back to Hack Reactor and help out
- share discounts
- in short, continue to geek out and spread the word

#### <a name="meetups"></a>Can I attend meetup [X] instead of class?

You may not miss class to attend events because the time spent working at Hack Reactor is much more valuable than hearing speakers, which you will be able to do as much as you want once you finish the course.

#### <a name="afterhours"></a>How do I invite an after hours guest speaker to Hack Reactor?,

Email your campus's communication@ if you want to bring in a guest speaker for an after hours talk.

#### <a name="guest"></a>I want to bring a guest to Hack Reactor!

Feel free to bring a guest into Hack Reactor during your free time or for social nights, but please email your campus's communication@ first!

## First 5 Weeks

#### <a name="structure"></a>What is the structure of the program?

FYI - The answer to this question is constantly changing due to student feedback and industry demands, so the following answer might not be totally accurate for your class.

The first 5 weeks are sprints that we have created for you, which last either two or four days.

The rest of the intensive is project periods and curriculum intended to prepare you for the job search. You will complete at least two large projects during this time and learn a ton about how to get a great job effectively.

#### <a name="knowanswer"></a>My help request Tech Mentor or HIR didn’t know the answer

This will always be true at HR or anywhere else, is not to be feared, and will ultimately provide you with access to a skill that otherwise would not be represented in the class.

The job of the help request Tech Mentor is never to give you the answer. They should lead you in the right direction to figure out the answer yourself. Giving you the answer cheats you from the opportunity to practice applying the correct methodology to quickly solve your own problems. If the Tech Mentor is doing their job effectively, they should always appear like they do not know the answer and they should facilitate moving you in the right direction. When they actually do not know the answer, in a way, it forces them to perform their role as originally intended, modeling for you how they would solve this issue and how they would go about figuring out what was wrong.

Moreover, the likelihood of every developer knowing every technology that we use in our tech stack is nearly 0. We work with professional developers who are building real software at the same time that they are helping students at Hack Reactor. As a result, we have some of the foremost thinkers on many subjects.  Some of them are experts in the field on Angular, or D3, or Node, or Rails. Inherent to this expertise are areas they know less about. I propose this is a strong plus, as opposed to some knowledge of everything -- especially when you get into the project periods and job search and are interested in those things the experts know about.

See [this page](http://helpdesk.makerpass.com) on how to use the help system.

#### <a name="studentprogress"></a>How can students gauge their progress in the program?

We closely monitor the progress of each student and will let you know if we are worried about you. Of course we are here to assist if you feel you are struggling so come and talk to someone before you feel overwhelmed.
Good ways to gauge yourself:
- able to finish the bare minimum requirements of sprints (core) on your own
- can you do bare minimum requirements? If not, you should tell a staff member
- gauge yourself against the curriculum, not other students
- do a solo sprint once
- use your experience with the assessment to gague your understanding of that week's content

#### <a name="HRprogress"></a>How does HR gauge how students are doing in the program?

This is something we are expert at and the short answer is by spending lots of time with you and looking at your work.

We have several safety nets that we apply and every time someone raises a red flag we assess those:
- Assessments are graded every week and it is the Tech Mentor's responsibility to look at them and report their status in our tracking system. Anyone who is not doing well is noticed and we investigate further. Tech Mentors know the list of people who are struggling and act largely as our security net.
- We all take notes. Even guest Tech Mentors and HIRs.
- Our Instruction Team members are in constant communication to keep tabs on the academic experience of our students.

In exchange for these constant reviews, we ask you to promise not to think about your status:
- Your job is to think about code, not how you are doing in the course
- We will let you know if you are struggling
- If some feeling is bubbling up, tell us, have us take a note of your concern and then you must let it go. Do not indulge yourself in the time consuming, enticing emotional roller coaster that is measuring yourself.

#### <a name="spectator"></a>What's up with spectator?

Spectator is an automated system that provides you with a summary report on how your toy problems and self-assessment questions did against a suite of unit tests. It is intended to be a helpful tool for you - it is NOT the final word on your code or your progress at Hack Reactor.

#### Is Spectator perfect?

No, far from it. The tests that Spectator runs on your code are designed with some reasonable edge cases in mind, but are not all encompassing. Failing all the tests doesn't mean you have a totally broken solution (one error might lead to multiple failing tests), and passing all the tests doesn't mean you have a perfect solution. It's useful and important to review Spectator's results, but realize that you may need to synthesize them a bit.

#### Should I be concerned if I fail one of Spectator's tests?

It depends. In general, as long as you understand the error messages presented by Spectator, and can quickly implement a fix, you're probably doing fine. If you don't understand a test, why your code failed it, or don't feel confident that you can implement a fix, this could be a red flag, and you should reach out for support.

#### Does Spectator support ES2015?

Yes! Spectator supports ES2015+ by transpiling files with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). Any JavaScript feature included in the [latest preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-latest/) can be used. The tradeoff for this support is that error messages can sometimes be a bit more obscure and/or line numbers in the stack trace don't map precisely to their original line numbers.

If you want to turn off transpiliation, create a `spectator.json` file in the root of the problem directory that looks like this:

```js
{
  "babel": false
}
```

#### Can I resubmit a Pull Request after addressing failing Spectator tests?

Yes. Your first Pull Request for a given self-assessment or toy problem should reflect your best effort, but you can re-submit to get a new Spectator report after addressing failing tests.

#### <a name="prioritize"></a>I’m done with the bare minimum requirements of a sprint, what should I do now?

Assuming it is still class hours, work on the advanced content of the sprint with your pair.

#### <a name="breakdown"></a>What is the breakdown between Bare Minimum Requirements and Advanced Content?

Bare minimum requirements are fundamental concepts that essential to becoming a competent developer. These give you a solid foundation, giving you the tools to further explore a given concept. Although we do not expect students to remember the intricacies of every bullet point, a baseline metric of progress in the course is the ability to work through all of the basics (in accordance with our high level goals for our students).

Advanced content is often intended to throw you in over your head and give you a challenge that is more reflective of tasks a mid-level or senior engineer might be required to do. In these kinds of tasks you will there will be much work even defining how to address a given problem or to even clearly articulate what a problem is. You will have to create a roadmap for your own work and find yourself making more choices about the fundamentals of what needs to happen in your code.

#### <a name="millionTODO"></a>There are a million things on my TODO list aka I'm not absorbing the material fast enough

During the first half of the program it is impossible that you will retain every intricacy of each framework that you learn doing our sprints and you are not expected to do so. It is okay if your todo list is ever growing, but you may be feeling overwhelmed.

If you feel that there are essential concepts that you need to review, I am sure that other students feel the same way. Form 8pm study groups (second day of the sprint usually works best) to review.

Bottom line: focus on the current sprint. Worrying about your progress hinders your learning process, so keep yourself in check. Come and talk to someone if you feel that you may be seriously struggling, and we can review your progress.

#### <a name="nevertechnical"></a>I have never done anything technical before.

That’s great! Not only does your [fine arts, psychology, art, music] background make you stand out in the job search process, but those things are actually highly technical. Because of your previous experience, you will be extremely well rounded by the time you finish the course.

We are not only teaching you how to write code, but how to learn. If you give your all to the program, after leaving HR you will be not only a well rounded developer but an intelligent learner and a communicative employee.

#### <a name="#downloadslides"></a> Why can't we download HR slides?

Although we <3 and trust you almost entirely, those slides **are** our school. If they were to get out (if your laptop was stolen by a goblin in the night) we would not have much of a business anymore. Thank you for understanding.

#### <a name="pullrequest"></a>What do I do if I can’t submit a pull request or if I’m having trouble with Github?

Our amazing HIRs are more than willing to help you with this. Please submit a help desk request via the Help Desk App.

#### <a name="pairingstations"></a>What do I do if I’m having pairing station maintenance issues?

Any issues with your pairing station (dead batteries, flickering monitor, software issues) should be sent to your campus's communication@. Do not send a help desk request - that’s for technical needs!

### Toy Problems

#### <a name="toyproblems"></a>How should I review toy problems?

Add pseudocode to solution describing every step, then delete the code, then reimplement based on your pseudocode.

### Assessments

#### <a name="assessmenthelp"></a>I’m have difficulty during the assessment - who should I talk to?

If you have a technical question or a pull request difficulty, please submit a help desk request or flag down a Tech Mentor.

## Pairing

#### <a name="whypair"></a>Why do we pair?

See the [wiki](?id=pair-programming)

#### <a name="effectivepair"></a>How can I be an effective pair?

When explaining anything, it is very important to carefully pick the words that you use so that you can speak effectively to each other. To reduce confusion, make sure that you mean exactly what you say (this is also just a great life skill).
* Be patient while working through the sprints to ensure that both members of the pair are on the same page.
* Be able to justify your reasoning; know exactly and communicate why you are making a decision. In general, you should be intentful when you code.
* Set expectations from the beginning of the pairing session
* Check in regularly to keep each other engaged. Sometimes you or your pair will become disengaged or sit back. Make sure that neither of you are driving or navigating too much.

See the [wiki](?id=pair-programming) for more information.

### Project Periods

#### <a name="MVPgoals"></a>What are the goals for the MVP Project?

Gives an opportunity to do a thing on your own and learn about your personal workflow before jumping into group projects. Teaches how to scope a project and how much time goes into building anything. Also this project is a great time to enjoy your newfound skillsets.

- Some students take a ton of risk and use totally new technologies and some feel more safe using things that they already know, either approach is fine.
- Not only to create a finished product, but learning process, teaches you a bit about what you are able to accomplish and need to work on.
- This is time to trip and fall before you have more serious projects.
- A chance to show yourself that you can engineer, building the confidence that you needed to know that you can build something on your own.
- Push yourself out of your comfort zone and forces you to be a conjurer, it is only a two day sprint so there is room to try.

#### <a name="WorkingOffsite"></a>Can I work at a nearby coffee shop?

_Hack Reactor is sometimes too noisy and I find myself having a hard time concentrating/ hearing myself think. Can I work at a nearby coffee shop?_

We understand that it can be a bit noisy on the floor with everyone chatting and pairing! That said, we ask you to remain on campus for your project period. We want to maintain the excitement of Hack Reactor deep into your project period, and we want you to all be able to bounce ideas off of each other. Being onsite during Hack Reactor hours is also a part of your Student Agreement.

If your team is in desperate need of a quick coffee break or stroll outside for some fresh air, check in with campus staff before leaving. Please keep your departures to less than 30 minutes&mdash;more than this may influence a conversation around required attendance. You all are the most important component to the Hack Reactor community, and we expect and love to have you here!


### Solo Week

#### <a name="soloweekresources"></a>What resources are available to students during solo week?

This may change depending on the time of year. Usually, the space is open to students for limited hours. Although staff members may be here, they have other duties and are generally busy. Sometimes guest Tech Mentors, alumni, and even staff will be willing to help you out, but this is called solo week for a reason.
HR is always closed on the Friday through Sunday before class starts again.


### Alumni

#### <a name="laterjobs"></a>Will you help me get a job if the one I take right after graduation does not work out?

We do not promise to, but most likely because we <3 you.

#### <a name="alumnihelp"></a>How can I help the school as a HR alumni?

Admissions Recommendations! Things to keep in mind:
- We value alumni recommendations! Tell us if you know of an excellent candidate!
- The best way is to send a quick note to admissions@galvanize.com
- Keep in mind Hack Reactor is not for everyone. Even though you know someone who is awesome who would like to come here, this does not necessarily mean HR is right for them!
- Only recommend applicants you think would thrive here! Not only is this in the best interest of HR, it's in the best interest of your applicant friend
- NOTE: There is a chance we'll reject someone you recommended and we can't give you confidential details about why
- Also, spread the word! Alumni are the best advertising and role models to prospective students. Graduating from HR is an accomplishment, and applicants will look up to you and want to learn more. You can tell them to email admissions@galvanize.com
