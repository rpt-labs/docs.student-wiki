## Peer Interview Practice

Interviewing is a skill that is mastered through practice.  In addition to formal mock interviews from a Technical Mentor, you should frequently be practicing with peers as part of your job search routine.

**Instructions:**

1. Pair up with a peer.  Decide who will be the interviewer vs. the interviewee.
1. The interviewee should let the interviewer know the specific company the mock interview is for.  Also, the interviewee should communicate any skill areas he/she would like to work on.
1. The interviewer should pre-select the reference / whiteboarding questions intended for use and be prepared in advance.  He/she must know the solution well in order to role play effectively.
1. The interviewer should take notes during the interview with strengths and areas of improvement for the interviewee.
1. It is powerful for the interviewee to record the session and review it afterwards.  Listen to how you respond to questions and improve on your delivery.  Pro tip: You can practice non-technical interviewing without a partner by asking yourself sample questions, recording an answer, reviewing your delivery and iterating!

### 1. Introductions (2m)
Assume you have just initiated the call with the interviewer.  Begin with salutations and some small talk.  The interviewer should kick off next steps.

### 2. Non-Technical / Behavioral (5-10m)
The interviewer should pull up the interviewee's resume.  Ask the interviewee a few of the questions below and practice non-technical interviewing for ~10 min.
* Tell me about yourself
* I'm looking at your resume, tell me more about... (e.g. Point X)
* Why should I hire you
* What do you know about the company?
* Why do you want to work here?  Why company X specifically?
* What project are you most proud about and can you walk me through that?
* What do you look for in a position? (Or: Describe your perfect job.)
* What was the biggest challenge at HR for you?
* Where do you like to be on the JS stack?
* What's the coolest thing you've ever coded?
* What are your strengths? (Or: What are you proud of?)
* What are your weaknesses? (Or: Tell me something thatâ€™s a challenge for you.)
* Tell me about a time you had a conflict and how you solved it. (Or: How do you resolve issues in a team?)
* What are your steps to problem solving?
* What side projects are you working on right now?
* What questions do you have for me?

### 3. Technical Quizzing (5-10m)

Interviews usually start getting technical by easing in with a few reference questions that are thought to be common knowledge by sharp developers.

Pick a few reference questions from the list below and ask them to your peer.

Keep asking questions until you can find a topic that your peer doesn't easily know so they can have a chance to feel how it feels to not know something during an interview, and perhaps help teach them the answer if you know it.

### 4. Whiteboarding (20-30m)

Whiteboard is a super important piece of the technical interview.

Practice the skills you learned about [here](https://github.com/remotebeta/student-wiki/wiki/How-To:-Whiteboard) with each other by picking a problem from below and whiteboarding a solution just like it was a real interview.

### 5. Post Interview Feedback (5m)
The interviewer should discuss strengths and weaknesses with the interviewee.  The interviewee should take notes and work on areas of weakness.
