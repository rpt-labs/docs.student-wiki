## Technical Assessment FAQ

- What is the Technical Assessment?
  - The Technical Assessment is a coding challenge that will test the knowledge and skills you've been working on in the first half of the course. It is a significant portion of the gating Summary Assessment, which means, failure to perform sufficiently on the Technical Assessment could result in your being unable to proceed with the remainder of the course.

- How is the Technical Assessment related to the Summary Assessment?
  - The Summary Assessment is a midterm evaluation on your proficiency in the course, largely centered around the question "Would we hire this person onto one of our teams?" The Summary Assessment gates your participation in the second half of the course. The Summary Assessment takes into consideration your technical proficiency, your ability to successfully collaborate with your pairs and groups, as well as your engagement with classroom requirements and expectations. The Technical Assessment is a major component of how staff evaluates your technical proficiency, and as such, serves as a major component of the gating Summary Evaluation.

- What resources am I allowed to use during the Technical Assessment?
  - To start, you may not use any tools that allow you to communicate directly with other students or engineers, or anything that was created at Hack Reactor (course materials, hackathon content, class notes, slide decks, etc.). Each challenge that you are given on the assessment will provide guidelines for you about what online resources you are allowed to use in support of completing that challenge. If you are unsure at all about whether or not you are allowed to use a particular resource, talk to a proctor on your floor.

- Can I collaborate with my peers?
  - To maintain the academic integrity of our assessment environment, we will ask you not to communicate with other people at all during the assessment. This means using email, Slack, cell phones, or any other communication channel is strictly forbidden. We will also ask you not to talk to your classmates for the duration of the assessment.

- What parts of the space are available to me during the assessment?
  - After our brief kickoff, we'll ask you to stay on your home floor until you have submitted your work. You may work anywhere on your home floor except for the conference rooms and the staff tables. You won't be able to leave the testing area for any reason until your assessment is complete, so please prepare accordingly.

- What if I have some kind of emergency?
  - If you have a pressing personal emergency or may be expecting an important phone call, please alert one of your proctors.

- What about lunch?
  - Since we ask you not to leave your home floor, we will provide lunch for you. If you have dietary restrictions or concerns, please email communication in the week before the Technical Assessment so we can plan accordingly. You're also welcome to bring your own lunch that day. Our "no talking" rule is still in place during lunch, so be prepared for a potentially awkward meal.

- What is the submission process for the Technical Assessment?
  - The submission process for the Technical Assessment is different from our weekly assessments. Make frequent commits, but **do not push your code**. When you are ready to submit your work, talk to a proctor on your floor, who will instruct you on how to proceed.

- How do I receive feedback on my Technical Assessment?
  - Our team of Technical Mentors will review your assessment code. They may reach out to you to offer some direct feedback or additional support This feedback process will usually be complete by the end of Week 7.

- How long do I have to complete the Technical Assessment?
  - We'll hold a very brief kickoff at 9am on the day of the assessment. You'll have from the end of that kickoff until 3:30pm to complete your work.

- How should I prepare for the Technical Assessment?
  - One of the most important skills that you have been developing is to be able to solve novel challenges with little direction or oversight. With that in mind, you can expect to see content on the assessment that is new to you. This means that targeted study may not be particularly helpful.

  - Your diligent efforts in solving the problems that arise in the sprints is the best way to prepare yourself for the kinds of challenges you will face on the Technical Assessment. In addition to this, any feedback you have gotten on your weekly assessments, or anywhere in the sprints where you do not feel confident that you could redo the work on your own, indicate places in your learning where you might be at risk. You should work to remediate your understanding in such places as soon as possible.

  - Being well rested for the day of the technical assessment will likely prove valuable to you.
