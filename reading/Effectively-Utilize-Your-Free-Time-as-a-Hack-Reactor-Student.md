## Effectively Utilize your Time as a Hack Reactor Student

On your quest towards becoming a world-class software engineer, you'll spend a lot of time at Hack Reactor...A LOT. A typical student finds herself with the following schedule:

8:30am-9:00pm Working at Hack Reactor
9:00pm-11:00pm Free Time
11:00pm-7:30am Sleep

As you can see, students have about a 2 hour block of time every day **maximum** to do activities outside of Hack Reactor. Your non-HR hours will be very limited.

As a result, you'll need to be mindful about how you spend this time. The following process will help you optimize the use of your limited free time:

1) Create a Google spreadsheet and list all the activities that you’d like to do during blocks of free time. For example:

- Play games
- Do yoga
- Meditate
- Go dancing
- Meet up with friends
- Respond to personal emails
- Watch movies
- Catch up on extra sleep

2) Plan out *when* you’ll do each of these activities. Scheduing recurring weekly events is a great approach. You might plan as follows:

- "Every Thursday at 9pm, I'll meet up with a friend for board game night."
- "Every Monday night I'll read my favorite book, then write personal emails.”
- “Every Wednesday, I’ll do yoga and then get some extra sleep.”

3) Look for places to maximize your lunch, dinner, and commute time. On the same spreadsheet, detail out how you want to spend your time during your commute (e.g. watching Netflix, enjoying a bike ride, calling up friends) and how you want to spend your time during lunch and dinner (e.g. with Hack Reactor buddies, with friends and family, alone).

4) Write any recurring, but necessary, activities that you do not enjoy (e.g. laundry, cleaning, grocery shopping) and see if others are willing to do them for you. You may be able to share these responsibilities with friends or hire other individuals to help you with these tasks using services like TaskRabbit.

Being mindful of all these choices will lead you to spend your time in a productive manner that will increase your happiness and well being while at Hack Reactor.
