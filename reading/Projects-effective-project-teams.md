## Effective Project Teams

Team failure is one of the top reasons for failure among software development teams.  Here's our top tips on executing as a group effectively:

### Agree on shared goals

* Have a frank discussion about the goals of each group member and ensure the project supports that.
* Everyone needs to be excited about the project and be willing to go above & beyond.
* Articulate and direct final vision for product and stick to your agreed goals and MVP.
  * When you think that you’re undershooting scope, undershoot some more
* Make sure that your tech stack is right for your project. Choose to use technologies that meet specific requirements.

### Set well-defined roles

* Have group members identify their strengths, weaknesses and development goals.
* Decide on roles accordingly.
* Make sure everyone feels like a part of the team.
* Be willing to make personal sacrifices -- sometimes you need to put others before yourself

### Aim for tight, constant communication and documentation

* Hold team standups and establish goals for each person 1-2x a day.
* The entire team should work together physically.
* Use Git for workflow to avoid conflicts.
* Being sensitive and respectful about others will improve communication.

### Practice project management

* Dedicate one team member as the project manager
* He / she should use a well-known tool to track tasks and assign tasks out to the team immediately after the standup
 * Standups are only useful if you have actionable items coming out of them!
 * Consider using: Pivotal Tracker or GitHub Issues or Trello
* Draw lines, make tough decisions to meet timelines.

### Leverage experts

* Your mentors are here for you
* Don't be shy about cold emailing an external subject matter expert (but don't depend on it!)

### Workflow

* **Pay attention to red flags and address them immediately**
* Pace yourself so you do not get burnt out and keep yourself in check to make sure that you are moving at a good pace
* Group debugging so nobody gets stuck, sit close together
* Write clean code. You’re working in a group and your team members need to know what’s going on.

### Checking in with your team members

**What types of things should you be asking?**

* Project goals (what are you hoping to create)
* Group goals (what are you hoping to get out of this experience together)
* Personal goals (what are you hoping to get out of this experience individually)

* Give group members one-on-one feedback (i.e., one delta, one positive).

* Address any concerns before they become problems (related to deliverables, division of workload, interpersonal issues, technical concerns, etc.).

* What is going well for the team right now?  What accomplishments should you celebrate?

* What areas for growth or improvement?  What might you have done differently if you had it to do over?  What changes should you make now?

* Each person check-in about their bio/psycho/social state (For example: “I’m feeling well-rested, inspired and engaged” or “I’m feeling under the weather, defeated and distracted” or something else)
