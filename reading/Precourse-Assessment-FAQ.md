## Precourse Assessment FAQ

Here at Hack Reactor we strive to create the best possible learning environment. We also aim to give you the tools you need to measure your own success. One such tool is the assessment, which has been made available to you beginning in Precourse.

**TL;DR** - the workflow for an assessment is as follows:

* Fork and clone the repo
* Complete the challenges
* Rate yourself
* Commit your code
* Submit a pull request
* No libraries (including underbar) are available -- you must write all solution code from scratch.

Take care to ensure the pull request source and destination are correct. The PR should be from your fork to your named branch on HR's master repo. For example, my username is `jamiedoe`; for my pull request, the source would be `jamiedoe:master` and the target would be `hackreactor:jamiedoe`.

The practice assessment, once available, will be located here: github.com/hackreactor/{cohortprefix}-self-assessments-precourse-01

The required Underbar assessment, once available, will be located here (insert class start date where indicated): github.com/hackreactor/{cohortprefix}-self-assessments-precourse-02

### FAQ

#### What is an assessment?

An assessment is a time-limited (<1hr) mini test with questions covering material you are currently working on or have recently covered. They are a normal part of the 12-week immersion program and having them in Precourse helps you practice.

#### How are they administered?

For Precourse students, they are self-administered and based on the honor system. While it is easy to cheat, you are doing yourself a major disservice by not attempting to complete the assessment on your own in the allotted time. We ask that you hold yourself accountable to the rules outlined in this FAQ and to the 1hr time limit.

#### Do I have to do the assessment?

YES. Submission of required assessments is a gating requirement to being able to join the cohort, just like the Precourse curriculum itself. The practice assessment is an exception.

#### Can I look stuff up on the internet? Or look at my prior code?

Yes, with an asterisk. You may search for concepts, ideas, syntax questions. However, you should not reference any pre-existing code - both your own, previously written code, or stuff you find on the internet.

#### How many self-assessments are there?

During Precourse, there are 2 assessments: 1 real assessment and 1 practice. The practice assessment is intended to help you work through the submission process. The real assessment will cover Underbar and concepts from the Start Coding in Javascript slide deck.

#### How do I submit my assessment?

The general workflow is to submit a pull-request from your fork to the branch with the same name as your Github username on the master hackreactor repo. Reach out to Admissions if your branch does not exist or your handle is misspelled. Detailed instructions are included with each repo on how to submit your assessment. Note you only need to submit a pull request for assessments, not assignments.

#### How many times can I submit?

We ask that you treat this as a test of your own knowledge and as such, use only the first submission to benchmark your performance. However, there is nothing stopping you from submitting additional pull requests with updated solutions. In fact, students often re-attempt the assessment after having time to learn where they could have done better.

#### After I submit, what happens?

Assessments are graded through a test system called Spectator. Your pull request will receive a comment from Spectator with the results of the test run. Generally it will be of the form X/Y where X is the number of tests you passed and Y is the total number of tests to be run. If you fail to submit your pull request correctly, Spectator will reject your pull request.

It's extremely important that your submission not contain any syntax errors. We encourage you to test your work by pasting solutions into the browser console and running the code manually. We also provide you with a tool to perform syntax and style checking, Pomander, which is included with instructions in the assessment repo.

Additionally, do not change the structure of the assessment repo itself. You should not add any extra libraries, files or folders, nor should you rename any of the provided files.

#### What happens if I do poorly?

You should consider poor test results an indicator for where you need to focus your further practice. Performing well on the required Underbar assessment is not a gating factor -- only the completion and submission of the assessment itself is.

#### Ok, how do I get started?

After finishing Section 1, complete the practice assessment. Do it when you have one hour to complete it.

You should complete the first real assessment, the Underbar assessment, after you finish Section 2. It must be completed within 24 hours of finishing Section 2 and within the time limit of 1 hour. For this one, we will check that you submit it.

If your branch of the assessment does not exist or your handle is misspelled, please reach out to Admissions so we can manually create one for you.
