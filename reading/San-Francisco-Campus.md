### Building Access[](#buildingaccess)

Once you have your key fob, you will have access to the Galvanize building 24/7.  As part of Hack Reactor, you will only work on the 3rd floor and in the basement lecture area (called Denali).  All other space in the building is intended for use by other programs and clients of Galvanize, please be mindful of our neighbors and refrain from working outside our designated areas.  On that note, when traveling between floors, please keep noise to a minimum so as not to disturb other Galvanize members/clients/guests.

* **Limits to building access**: In our own space, our Operations team conducts sweeps and check ups on the space prior to 8am, so please avoid occupying the space in the mornings until the prescribed time on the Academic calendar.  On the flip side of this, you are welcome to stay and work outside of class hours, but sleeping at Galvanize is absolutely prohibited.
* **Traveling between floors**: Please use the elevators or emergency stairwells (as noted on the diagram above) to travel between levels at the Galvanize building. Often times there will be events happening on the first floor, open seating area. Large groups of students traveling down the main stairwell through the first floor is discouraged as it may disrupt events or those working on the floor.
* **Conference rooms/Phonebooths**: Conference rooms are available to students by invite from staff only.  There are phonebooths provided for everyone's use throughout the Galvanize space, including on the 3rd floor.  The phonebooth policy is simple: First come first served - no more than 60 mins per session.
*  **Bikes**: If you ride your bike to Hack Reactor, you can store it in the designated space on our floor. Please be mindful of others when storing and retrieving your bike. All bikes and scooters must be registered with the team at the Tehama St. front desk and owners receive a sticker to be placed on the bike/scooter. Galvanize conducts periodic bike/scooter audits to ensure bikes/scooters are not being permanently stored at Galvanize.
* **Electric Scooters, Skateboards and other modes of transport**: We love that students utilize all manner of efficient transportation to get to Hack Reactor. These vehicles **must** be stored in the bike storage area, as long as they do not block walkways or take up undue room.
* **Lost and found**: The Lost and Found cabinet is a silver cabinet on the main (3rd) floor near the kitchen/lounge area. If you have lost something, please email hrsf.communication@galvanize.com and check the cabinet every so often. The Lost and Found cabinet is cleaned out every Sunday, so make sure to take your items home.  There is also a Lost and Found located at the Tehama St. front desk.
* **Temperature adjustment**: Each classroom and conference room has a thermostat to adjust temperature. For any other changes, please email hrsf.communication@galvanize.com to see if an adjustment can be made (this is not always a guarantee).
* **Printing**: Access to the wireless network is covered at Orientation, and instructions on how to print are located above every printer on every floor.
* **Deliveries/packages**: Students may receive packages at Galvanize provided they include their name, Hack Reactor and Galvanize in the Name/Address line (see example below). Upon arrival, they are stored in the mail room behind the front desk. Students are entirely responsible for tracking their packages: if you are expecting a package, check the tracking number/details regularly and enquire at the front desk when you believe it has arrived. You will also be asked to acknowledge receipt via signature on a digital device.

### Kitchen Etiquette

* **Coffee Cups**: The best bet is to bring your own travel mug with a lid on day 1 and label it as yours. Otherwise, we have purchased closed lid travel mugs for you to borrow while you are hanging out here in our space. Please treat these cups as you would your own and always be sure to wash it at the end of the day.
* **Shared Refrigerator**: Please keep in mind that the refrigerator is a shared space and all students on your floor need to be able to access it. In respect of the refrigerator real estate and your fellow cohort-mates, only bring in 1-2 days worth of food at a time.
* **Label your food with name & date**: Anything without a name and dated label will be thrown out.
* **Throw out your food**: Don't leave food in the refrigerator for more than a few days. If you choose to use the shared refrigerator space, no one but you is responsible for keeping your leftovers in order.  Every Saturday, the refrigerator will be cleaned and if you are storing any items there, they will be removed and placed on the table for you to claim before they are thrown away.
* **Food Deliveries**: If you are having food delivered to Hack Reactor, tell the delivery person to bring it to the front desk area on the Tehama side of the building (44 Tehama St). If food deliveries become disruptive, we may ask that you not have food delivered to our space.
* **Dishes**: We expect all our students to be good stewards of the space. Please use the dishwashers provided to clean dishes.  If dishwasher is full or running (as indicated by the sign), please hand-wash your dish. *Do not* leave your dishes in the sink for others to wash.
* **Top of the refrigerator and cabinets**: Please do not use refrigerator tops for storage. Food rots and any other things being placed there make the space look cluttered.
* **Disposal System**
    * **Recycle** as much as possible
        * YES: Rigid plastic
        * YES: Aluminum cans
        * YES: Glass bottles
        * YES: Clean paper
        * NO: Soft plastic like saran wrap/plastic bags
        * NO: Pizza boxes, and other food-stained papers/cardboard products (compost instead)
    * **Compost** as much as possible of what's left
        * YES: Food scraps
        * YES: Paper plates/bowls/cups/napkins
        * YES: Pizza boxes

        * NO: Plastic of any sort (See Recycle for appropriate disposal of plastics)
        * NO: Tetra paks (Almond & Soy milk containers)
        * NO: Tea bag envelopes; these are lined with a non-recyclable plastic.
    * **Landfill** as a last resort.
        * YES: Soft plastic must go in the landfill. (Plastic bags, tea bag envelopes, tetra paks)
        * YES: Plastic straws
        * YES: Stickers
        * YES: Laminated paper
        * OK: Any rigid plastic food containers that you can't stand washing out is best in the landfill, so it doesn't contaminate the paper in the recycling.

### Safety

**Precautions recommended by the local Police Dept:**

* They recommend buddying up with someone else.
* Do not wear earphones while walking.
* Do not have valuables in plain sight on your way to the BART (like texting while walking).
* If you are going home late, and are not planning on working on your computer, leave it in the building.  The odds of someone breaking into the building and stealing your laptop are lower than someone snagging it from you on the BART/on your way home (but, of course, we are not liable for your belongings, and you leave them here at your own risk).

### Building Safety

During week one we ask that students make an effort to speak to or introduce themselves to the front desk and door staff at the Galvanize building for familiarity.

Please also familiarize yourself with the emergency exits and protocol posted in the building.

### Social Nights

**Social Night** is held on Saturdays and starts at 6:00pm. The duration depends upon the event, and will be clearly communicated with every invite. It's a time to network with other cohorts and HR staff. Relax, enjoy yourself, and have a good time!

**Dos & Don'ts of Social Night**

You **must** RSVP for social night. It is essential for accurate planning by the staff member who volunteers to host each night. When you RSVP you are allowed to bring a guest, just make sure you add them to the RSVP. (+1 or +2 depending on the options given from the host, which sometimes requires a name given for said person) Some events are held off campus, and reserving your spot on the invite is the only way to acquire accurate space/resources for the event to be successful.

**You are responsible for your guest** so please make sure they are aware of the rules of the space here at HR. Make sure you let them know where the bathrooms are, and introduce them to your cohort!

Given that our staff members are volunteering to host these events, it is mandatory that you clean up after yourself. If you see something laying around where it shouldn't be, please help out and put it back, or throw it away. Respect our space!

**Do not move staff items**
Absolutely do not sit at staff desks, take staff chairs, computer, cords, etc. If you need something, ask your host!

**The Rule of Thumb**

Here's one key thing to keep in mind, these nights are meant to be a fun, casual time had by everyone. If something is happening that isn't making you feel welcome in the space, please let your host know in a courteous manner so they can address and hopefully resolve whatever it may be. Although the host is amazing for volunteering for this event, and we all love them for it, they can't be everywhere at all times. Please treat others the way you want to be treated, and have respect for everyone's well being.

###  Housing

Finding housing in SF can be quite tricky. Your best pay-and-go option would be one of the many, many hostels around the downtown area. There are probably half-a-dozen within a 3 block radius of our classroom. You won't be spending much time there anyway, so a bunk room is probably a fine low-cost option. It's worked for many of our students in the past. Maybe start w/ [HostelWorld](http://www.hostelworld.com/)

Other than that, [Craigslist temporary/ sublet boards](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sub/) can be a good place to start. [AirBnB](http://www.airbnb.com) is also a good bet.

### Neighborhoods

San Francisco has very distinctive neighborhoods, many catering to sub-cultures of various sorts. Blindly searching for housing without considering the neighborhood you'll be in can lead to unhappiness.

Check out [this informative and humorous guide](https://thebolditalic.com/moving-to-san-francisco-the-bold-italic-san-francisco-fd5762a7c6e7).

Hack Reactor, located in the Galvanize building at [44 Tehama Street San Francisco, CA 94102](https://goo.gl/maps/9f6UECrVATA2), is surrounded by:
* SOMA: Tech startup central. Fancy coffeeshops & lunch spots mixed with light industrial feel and a diverse mixed-use community.
* Financial District: Just as it sounds.
* Chinatown: Historic SF district. Bargain prices on goods, food, etc.
* Hayes Valley: Stroller-city. Quality restaurants. Central location.

If you're ok with a bit of a commute, follow a lightning fast [BART](http://www.bart.gov) light rail train or pokey [MUNI line](http://www.sfmta.com) streetcar out into the funky East Bay (Oakland & Berkeley) or the... ummm... wherever the MUNI goes.

### Nightlife

* Forget it.
* You're going to be coding until your brain turns off on you.
* Drag yourself home, collapse into bed.
* Rinse and repeat for 3 months.

### Public Transportation

SF is 7x7 square miles so walking is always a great way to see the [city] (http://www.sfcityguides.org)

San Francisco has several transportation options; [BART](http://www.bart.gov) (which stands for Bay Area Rapid Trasit) is a subway system that goes about most of the Bay Area. [MUNI](http://www.sfmta.com) is the public transit system that exhists soley in San Francisco. It has a variety of vehicles from subway/light rail system, busses, trollies (f-line), and cable cars

Payment for each can be a pain, make sure to pick up a Clipper card at any Walgreens or Bart/Muni subway terminal auto payment station that will let you store dollar values and simply swipe upon entering any of the vehicles.

If you are staying in San Francisco, you can opt for the monthly pass that is good with MUNI only  (unlimited MUNI access for a month +3 extra days into the next month) and a MUNI/SF BART pass (This is good for all MUNI & use of BART within the limitations of San Francisco stations. Embarcadero through Balboa Park and is only valid for the month for BART and +3 days for MUNI)
http://www.sfmta.com/getting-around/transit/fares-passes/monthly-passes

NOTE: Clipper Card is now accepted on all forms of public transit i.e. AC Transit, Bart, Muni, Ferries that go across the bay etc.

If you have any questions on these, please feel free to research your options at: https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/index.do
