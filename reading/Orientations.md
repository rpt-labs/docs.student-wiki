## Orientations

This is how you'll use this document:

* **Read only as far as you are currently assigned**:  Each section below begins with instructions for when you need to have reviewed the material. While you're welcome to read ahead, you aren't responsible for knowing the material until that day comes.
* **Know every Etiquette point completely**: Please become very familiar with the etiquette of the space and the class, as you'll be expected to follow all of these guidelines. We used to go over these "rules of the road" in a lecture during Week 1, but in an effort to conserve our precious in-class time, we now insist that all students read it themselves and know it to a pop-quizzable level. Please be extremely well versed in any sections labeled "etiquette" in this document prior to arriving on your first day.


### Orientation 1: Ground Rules and Culture

Read this orientation as soon as you are enrolled in the class

* **Communication**: Use your campus's communication@ as your one point of contact once you are a student on-site at Hack Reactor, for all emails with Hack Reactor staff.
  * **Why?** We have designed this system to make your life easier (only 1 email to remember!) and ensure reliable follow-up on all of your inquiries. On the flip side, we can only commit to responding to inquiries you make through your campus's communication@.
  * **Please set up a filter for your campus's communication@** to ensure these messages get 'Marked Important' and do not go to your spam folder. You can [click this link](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#create-filter/has=communication%40hackreactor.com&sizeoperator=s_sl&sizeunit=s_smb) to get started, and [follow these instructions](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en) if you need any more help with filters. This must be done before entering the first day of class.
  * You are expected to check your email and your cohort's Slack channel throughout the day to receive up-to-date announcements and respond to action items.
* **Effective Emails**: Once you start using communication@ as your dedicated communication channel with our staff members, you should always strive towards creating a warm and professional vibe that will inspire people to want to team with you and actively want to resolve issues or answer your questions. Here are a few pro tips:
  * Use a cheerful greeting at the beginning and a closing salutation at the end of your email, such as "Hi HR Team!" or "Many thanks," and sign your name
  * Don't forget using "please" and "thank you"
  * Bonus points for a fun gif or some other type of social connecting language 
* **Attendance**: The attendance system is designed to encourage accountability by students while allowing for minimal staff intervention for punctuality and absence concerns.
  * Each morning students will log into the Attendance app (Zoom for remote) **before** 9AM, at which point if they do not, are considered late for class.  Students are expected to sign in even if they are late as failure to sign in will result in an absence being recorded for the day.  And yes, you must be on site when you sign in, without exception.
  * **IMPORTANT NOTE: In the rare instance that you are running late or expecting to be absent, YOU MUST SEND an email to your campus's communication@ with brief details regarding your tardiness/absence.**
  * Hack Reactor is an intensive, rigorous program and consequently we have intensive expectations for student participation. Students can miss a **maximum of three days** for unforeseen circumstances, such as illness, family emergency, etc. We also count **three tardies as equal to one absence**. Please note that tardies include both arriving late and leaving early.  If you miss 3 hours of class or arrive after 12pm, this counts as an absence for the entire day.
    * From our experience, this is the maximum amount of time that you can miss and still keep up with our material. The Hack Reactor is incredibly intense and every hour here is essential to your progress and future success and therefore, we cannot allow excused absences for any reason. Due to the nature of our program we **are not able to offer you any material missed while you are away other than those given in class.** Furthermore, the cohort works as a team and relies on having the support of the group, so having anyone out is extremely disruptive to both your own education and those of the people around you.
  * Students who have more than three absences (which may be a combination of tardies and missed days) are in **violation of their Hack Reactor contract** and will be removed from the course. If you are struggling with the attendance policy, please speak with your Coordinator or Counselor.
  * Students need to be **on-site** during regular programming hours **(9AM-8PM)**, outside of lunch, dinner, and work-out breaks. If you find yourself off-site during regular programming for any reason, please notify staff immediately by emailing your campus's communication@.
* **Punctuality**:
  * **Being on time for class**: Class starts promptly at 9am. Be sure you're already seated and situated at that time. 
  * **If you're late to lecture, announce a reason**: Arriving to class on time is a very big deal. Just like if a staff member was late, whenever a student is late, an explanation is in order. No matter the reason, arriving late (at the start of the day or after lunch), you are expected to interrupt briefly with a greeting of either "good morning" or "good afternoon". You'll be acknowledged, and will have a chance to explain the circumstances. **Do not simply walk in and hope no one noticed.**
  * **Subscribe to Google notifications on the student calendar.**  This feature is available on Google calendars and will notify you via email on new events, changed events and canceled events: https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37242
* **Illness**: If you need to be out sick, send an email to your campus's communication@ to let us know if you absolutely cannot come in. The program is very rigorous and it's best not to miss any time if possible. Use your best judgment to decide whether or not you can come in. If your illness starts to affect your learning, it may be a viable option to go home. Always keep in touch with us when you are going to miss any scheduled time for any reason.
  * If you are feeling unwell but still able to come in to Hack Reactor, be considerate of your fellow peers and take preventative measures to keep the illness from spreading and help the community remain healthy healthy. Please read the following protocols:
  * If your illness is contagious, ask your campus staff for a mask. This holds especially true if you have signs of coughing or sneezing, or if your illness is airborne.
  * Wash your hands often and thoroughly. Rinse, lather, and repeat. We also have hand sanitizer available for your use around the space.
  * We have tissues for your use as well. Feel free to use them and dispose of them properly after use.
  * If your illness is contagious, we ask that you sit in the back or on the sides of the lecture area to keep the community clean.
  * Don't share food, tumblers, or dishes with your cohortmates. Please wash your dishes thoroughly after every use to prevent the spread of illness.
* **Protect Our Materials** We have worked extremely hard to build this curriculum, and need your help keeping it private. Please only use our official publication script to publish the work you add to our instructional repos. A fair amount of our materials are *not* intended to be shared, as they represent untold months of R&D toil. When in doubt, do not publish!
* **Conduct**:
  * **Minimum Requirements**: We want to create the most cohesive learning environment possible.  Therefore, Hack Reactor has a zero-tolerance policy toward hostile and disrespectful treatment of other students. If you find yourself raising your voice or being unkind to another student, take a deep breath, stretch, or go for a walk to ground yourself. It should go without saying that lewd behavior, bigotry and "isms" of any sort, and raunchy locker room humor is strictly forbidden. Behave like you would in a professional workplace, not like you would in a bar.
    * *How to deal with discrimination or harassment**: As the student agreement states, discrimination and harassment are completely unacceptable within our tightly-knit program. While we encourage you to assume your colleagues have the best intentions in everything that they say and do here in the community, it happens in rare occasions that people accidentally or neglectfully hurt the people around them with discriminatory statements or actions. If you are ever concerned that you or a fellow student is suffering from such an incident, please elevate the information to your cohort's class coordinator or counselor immediately. They will take the appropriate next steps to minimize potential harm for all parties involved. It's extremely important that you trust in your operators and counselor to handle such reports with sensitivity, since silence only enables such situations to get further out of hand. You can expect the coordinator and counselor to deal with the information responsibly, elevate it to the appropriate level for help when needed, and handle everyone involved with as much respect for the privacy of all parties as possible. The Hack Reactor Harassment Policy can be read in full here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFoJOSIKBp_fnIp3biLwLHprJIZ1rQTQQXMgIJo7ku4
  * **Drugs and Alcohol on campus**: Hack Reactor is a drug and alcohol free campus. There are rare occasions when HR hosts events in which alcohol is provided, however, drinking/bringing alcohol, or using illicit drugs on campus is prohibited. Inebriated hacking can lead to really bad code and is disruptive to the learning environment.
  * **Competition**: A bit of friendly competition as motivation can be a positive thing, but striving to be better than others doesn’t help you reach your potential as a person. (Read more in [The Case Against Competition](http://www.alfiekohn.org/parenting/tcac.htm) and [No Contest: The Case Against Competition](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00GQDOD7Q?pc_redir=1405376978&robot_redir=1). Be eager to offer help, especially to those who look frustrated, or have had a few bad days. Be sure your help is actually wanted before you start giving it. Pay it forward and be the support you would like to receive in that instance. Note that although we organize some weekly competitions between students and staff, we do not condone or facilitate student-student or class-class competitions.


### Orientation 2: Program Format

Read this orientation 1 week before class starts

* **A Little Advice**: You're about to start Hack Reactor! Here's some advice that should help you make the most of your time here:
  * **Go to lunch with your peers**: Even if you bring your lunch. Going out to bond will serve you tremendously, both in your career and for your general health and happiness.
  * **Mingle with as many different people as possible**: The other classes, the alumni, the staff, the visitors. If you find yourself out to drinks with a bunch of folks, go sit with the ones you don't already know.
  * **You learn more than just coding at Hack Reactor**: When companies say that they hire for a "culture fit," they mean that they want employees who are kind and compassionate, making them easy to collaborate with and be around. Hack Reactor graduates are team-oriented individuals who will represent themselves and their school well to the community at large.
  * **Make a good impression**: Remember that the people you meet here--students, alumni, and staff--are your best connections as you move forward in this industry. Use this time to make the best impression possible on us all. Everyone here wants to be a bridge for you--don't burn them. Take advantage of your extra-curricular opportunity to fill your network with amazing people who care deeply about your success.
* **Student Presentations**: Students will do nightly 5 minute presentations on a topic that they are passionate about and will help educate the rest of the cohort.
  * you DO NOT have to be an expert on the topic. There is high value in speaking on a topic that you DO NOT feel comfortable in or have not fully fleshed out.
  * the topic should be valuable to other students.
    * Ideally, the topic 1) applies specifically to student experience, 2) involves research of a technical topic (not necessarily coding related), 3) has obvious value to the students (they're going to be using the info you spoke about in the near future), and/or 4) is hard to find existing info on
    * Student Presentations should be about something technical or programming related, but you're encouraged to interpret that creatively. If you like a particular board game a lot, you might explain something technically interesting about the game theory that makes it interesting/fun to play.
    * Note that the best presentations are generally about hard techincal concepts made easy, since most classes tire of seeing too many amusing topics that don't also enrich their education.
  * We encourage everyone to give a presentation during their time at Hack Reactor. Seniors are encouraged to give talks about technologies they used in their projects.
  * Be mindful to speak on topics that are work appropriate (staying clear of things that may be considered derogatory or off-color - Counselors will also have access to the signup form and may follow up if they want more info regarding the topic of your presentation)
  * Try your best to stay within the 5 minute time limit, definitely do not go over 10 minutes
  * Only sign yourself up to give presentations
  * A new sign up sheet will be available to cohorts during Week 6
  * [Some YouTube videos of general presentation best practices and advice from Matt Abrahams, author of "Speaking Up Without Freaking Out."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2QLTdc2sTo&list=UU5rhde2RHYNSF8aYKO-OHlw)
  * Examples of talks that went well:
    * Wind-farming on buildings
    * Architecture automation
    * The chemical process of brewing beer
  * Topic ideas:
    * Experiences or knowledge gained from a previous job in tech
    * Advanced section of the sprint you just did
    * Something you've researched and discovered as part of the sprint you've done (inheritance sprint + jsperf, grunt, build tools, angular)
    * Single page application + authentication
    * A topic you are passionate about (“empathy”, “emotional intelligence”, “a language you have learned” etc…) 
  * Good and Bad Examples of Topics Related to Sports
    * good: analysis of sports teams performance over time (scraping data, statistics, etc)
    * good: I used to be a physical therapist, here's an analysis of what makes athletes succeed at a level above * the average person (include scientific stuff) —not just opinion.
    * bad: this team is good, this team sucks (here are some stats to back this up)
    * good: I built a game, some of the challenges in building such a game
    * good: I'm a board game designer and I've spent the last 3 years exploring game mechanics. Here's what separates an amazing/successful game from a very similar one that no one likes...
    * bad: here's a game I love playing for hours on end and here's the gameplay videos i made)


### Orientation 3: Hack Reactor's Teaching Model

Read this orientation 1 week before class starts.

* **Toy Problems**: Every morning you are required to complete an interview-style question that tests your knowledge of programming fundamentals and algorithms.
  * Please finish in the time allotted (from the end of the solution lecture from the previous day's toy problem to 10AM) and submit a pull request (before 10AM)-- there are instructions on how to do this in the README. If you do not finish during that time, make it a priority to finish before the solution lecture the next day. Recommended-- take an hour or so at 8PM to run through the problem either on your own or with a classmate.
  * Note: toy problems are difficult, but you will have practice with them throughout the entire course so do not worry if they blow you out of the water in the beginning.
  * Toy Problem Solution Lectures (TPSL) are not mandatory to attend but suggested if you need more clarity on how to efficiently solve the previous day's toy problem. TPSLs happen directly after kick off on your home floor. If you do not feel the need attend the TPSL, it is expected that you will depart the area quietly and work quietly during the TPSL so as not to distract from the lecture.
* **Checkpoints**: These multiple-choice quizzes test your comprehension on the current sprint and help identify gaps in your knowledge base as a guide for where to focus your attention during personal study time. Checkpoints will occur during the first half of the course and are scheduled on the regular Academic Calendar. Be sure to practice on checkpoints that you previously found difficult!
* **Behavior in lectures**
  * **Please do not "help" lecturers by interjecting *during lecture* to clarify points for other students**: We are glad that you are passionate about helping lectures progress smoothly, but adding comments about what you've learned or trying to contribute to a teaching moment turns out to be counter-productive an overwhelming majority of the time. Without a lot of lecture training, your comments are likely to shift the focus of the lecture significantly and can break useful trains of thought.
  * **Learn to explain the topics yourself**: During the lecture and during student questions periods, your main goal should be to understand the point being explained. This is what most people believe "learning" consists of. But remember, *"Expertise is knowing the right way to solve a problem. Mastery is knowing all the wrong ways too."* If you already understand a topic, you can focus on the higher-level goal of understanding exactly why it's confusing for others. This often-overlooked use of brainpower is what turns experts into masters. Your goal here should be to "hone your own ability to communicate in a way that prevents anyone speaking with you from remaining confused."
  * **No genuine questions are dumb**
  * **Some questions and most comments are "out of bounds" and should be deferred until after the lecture. Lecturers should/will flag out-of-bounds questions and comments.**
  * **No video recording during the lectures.** Hack Reactor material is designed to be consumed only in the Hack Reactor space. Please do not take video of your Tech Mentor during the lecture. Slides will be made available after the lecture for you to review.
  * **Bring your laptop to lecture**
  * **Be present during lectures**: Giving the lecture your undivided attention is expected and shows respect for the lecturer and the material being presented. Checking emails, texting, and other distractions can be disruptive to those around you.
  * **Continuing to sit through a TECHNICAL lecture is optional.** While we do require you to attend the beginning of **every lecture on time**, if you know the material being covered, you may go back to working on other projects or reviewing other lectures with which you were not comfortable.
  * **If you leave the lecture, please do so quietly and with minimal distraction.**
* **Tech Mentor Availability**:
  * **"Favor mode"**: Tech Mentors are in "favor mode" before 9am, during lunch & dinner, and after 5:30pm. These are off-duty times for them. Although they frequently choose to help students anyway during these hours, this is a favor they're doing for the student, and we ask you take care to make them feel thanked and appreciated for it. It's like bugging your programmer friends. They'll often help you, but you definitely owe them one, and you buy them a six pack every now and then as a gesture of thanks.
  * **Never ambush Tech Mentors with technical questions**: The help request system is the appropriate way to lodge a technical question. If you're not convinced that the Tech Mentor will be genuinely captivated by what you're about to say, it's probably an item better suited for a help request. This distribution of labor ensures that you get the help you need while reserving Tech Mentors' time for instructing.
  * **(Almost) Never ambush staff with non-technical questions**: If you're trying to resolve some question about the program or what you should do in a particular situation, email is more appropriate than is instinctive.  If you think it's an exception this time, ask yourself: Is this urgent?  Is it also crucial?  If not, email.
    * Example exceptions:
        * "My friend is the VP of Engineering for Facebook, and wants to visit the school in twenty minutes.  Is a staff member free?"
        * "I just broke down crying in the bathroom.  Can we talk?"
    * Example non-exceptions:
        * "Hey, my friend is [insert impressive description].  Should I invite him/her to be a guest Tech Mentor or speaker?"
        * "Hey, I'm going to be out next week Saturday for a wedding.  Can I get early access to the repo?"
* **Help System**:
  * **Don't ask for help before doing research yourself**.
  * **Don't ambush Help Desk HIRs**: You **must** submit a help request through the Help Desk App.
  * **Hit the help button and then wait your turn**: our goal is to have all help requests attended to within ~5 minutes, and to point you in the right direction within ~5 minutes of working with you.
  * **Ask for help finding the answer; do not ask for the answer**: the Help Desk staff are not supposed to give you answers. Rather, they should point you in the right direction and show you their thought processes. Much of what you will learn from working with them is the debugging process. Giving you the answer cheats you from the opportunity to practice applying the correct methodology to quickly solving your own problems.
  * **Sometimes your Help Desk HIR will not know the answer:** This will always be true at HR or anywhere else, is not to be feared, and will ultimately provide you with access to a skill that otherwise would not be represented in the class. This kind of event allows the help-request respondent to model their thought process for you in how they solve issues and go about figuring out what is wrong.
  * **Appropriate topics for the help desk**
    * A question about what a sprint prompt means
    * A question about a toy problem
    * A question about something you didn't understand in lecture
    * A question about a blog post you're writing
    * An issue you and your pair are having
* **Contributing to the Curriculum**: We love getting your pull requests to the repos you work on as a student!
  * To make suggestions to a github repo, send an email to your campus's communication@ email that points to the pull request. As with any open source contribution, your work may or may not be merged, but many bug fixes and improvements have come from student contributions.
  * If the problem is not in a repo (for example, a typo in a slide deck), please send an email to your campus's communication@ with a link to the content where you found the error, with as much information as possible about the error (where the problem is, why you think it may be an error, your suggestion for improving it).
  * If a bug or other problem in the repo is blocking your work and you need a speedy response, please let us know via a help request. An HIR can help you figure out if it is an intentional part of the curriculum or a legitimate bug.
* **Video solution lectures**: At the conclusion of each sprint, you'll get access to a video in which our instructors walk you through important aspects of completing the sprint. You'll get to see one possible implementation and learn about the motivations and best-practices that drove our implementation. You can review these videos throughout your time as a student at Hack Reactor.
  * These videos demonstrate one possible implementation for the sprint. It's likely that your code will look very different from what is displayed in the video. Our implementations are meant to be instructive, but do not represent the only way to approach the problems in the sprint.
  * **Adjusting Playback Speed**: If you wish to view the videos with variable playback speeds, open the video in Safari and use `SHIFT + RIGHT ARROW` to increase speed and `SHIFT + LEFT ARROW` to decrease speed.
  * Viewing Errata: The video lectures are accompanied by errata which you should be certain to view. In addition to pointing out minor mistakes in the video, the errata will also point out important information about the technologies covered which have changed very recently. Errata is located **below the video**. The iFrame that displays the video is intended to fit the screen precisely, so, if you don't make a point to scroll down, you won't actually be able to see the errata. ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/7227245/13295536/37819d40-dade-11e5-89d1-ce2c34a46d91.png)
* **Assessments**: Each week, you'll be given an assessment designed to provide you insight about how much you've learned and what you still need the most work on. The workflow for taking an assessment is almost identical to the normal [git workflow](?id=git-workflows), except for one added requirement:
  * **You must start every problem**: Do at least a little work on every prompt. Even if you don't have time to write code, leave comments that describe your intent at as granular a level as you have time for. Leaving a prompt blank is tantamount to failing a prompt and you'll get much more credit for attempting it at all, even if only in the form of comments about your intent or pseudo-code describing your plan. It's important you've done at least a little work on all the prompts, before returning to complete the ones that seems easiest to you.
  * **Using Assessments to assess your progress through the course**: Spectator is an automated system that provides you with a summary report on how your toy problems and self-assessment questions did against a suite of unit tests. It is intended to be a helpful tool for you - it is NOT the final word on your code or your progress at Hack Reactor. The following will guide you in how to best use Spectator reports in conjunction with self-assessments and toy problems to help you assess your own progress through the course.
  * **Spectator is not perfect**: The tests that Spectator runs on your code are designed with some reasonable edge cases in mind, but are not all encompassing. Failing all the tests doesn't mean you have a totally broken solution (one error might lead to multiple failing tests), and passing all the tests doesn't mean you have a perfect solution. It's useful and important to review Spectator's results, but realize that you may need to synthesize them a bit.
  * **Should I be concerned if I fail one of Spectator's tests?**: It depends. In general, as long as you understand the error messages presented by Spectator, and can quickly implement a fix, you're probably doing fine. If you don't understand a test, why your code failed it, or don't feel confident that you can implement a fix, this could be a red flag, and you should reach out for support. It's particularly interesting when your self identified grade from the Grading Scale is misaligned with Spectator's report. Try to understand what went wrong and reach out if you need help.
  * **Can I resubmit a Pull Request after addressing failing Spectator tests?**: Yes. Your first Pull Request for a given self-assessment or toy problem should reflect your best effort, but you can re-submit to get a new Spectator report after addressing failing tests.
  * **Self-Grading**: When submitting your pull request, please remember to add one self-assessed grade from the table below for each of the questions, based on the Grading Outline provided. Place these grades in the comment of the pull request.
  * **Assessment Grading Scale**:
* Technical Assessment: The Technical Assessment is a coding challenge that will test the knowledge and skills you've been working on in the first half of the course. It is a significant portion of the gating Summary Evaluation, which means, failure to perform sufficiently on the Technical Assessment could result in your being unable to proceed with the remainder of the course.

Qualitative grade | Meaning
---|---
Complete             | You believe your solution to be fully complete and meeting the specified requirements.
Mostly complete      | Your solution is well on its way to being complete, but you ran out of time or can't remember exactly how to do **one** particular aspect. You believe anyone who understands the problem well would endorse your solution as the right one, and know pretty clearly how to finish up any last touches.
Significant progress | You have the right idea and were heading in a good direction. Covers everything between Mostly Complete and Attempted.
Attempted            | You were very challenged by the prompt and had trouble making any significant progress on the problem, but wrote at least one meaningful line of code that appears to be a genuine attempt.
Not attempted        | Whether you've thought much about the problem or not, you have no lines of code to show for the problem. (Note, you should avoid ever getting into a situation where this is the grade you'd give yourself. Make a passing attempt at each problem before going back to complete any one problem.)

### Orientation 4: Welcome to the space

Read this orientation 1 week before class starts
* **Furniture and Equipment**: Email your campus's communication@ if you notice chairs/any furniture is broken/malfunctioning.
* **Cubbies**: Cubbies are provided for your use. Please be mindful to keep only what you need on a daily basis in there, and empty it at the end of each week on Saturday. All cubbies are labeled with student names to ensure that everyone has a space to stow their belongings while here, but we ask that you clean them out at the end of the week to ensure that the space stays tidy and organized. We ask that you do not place any items on top of the cubbies. Is your bag/backpage bulky and doesn't seem to fit in the cubby? There are hooks on the walls near workstations that you can also utilize. If you are having trouble finding a place for you items, please email communication@ to assist you.
* **Label your power cord and chargers**: In your envelope from your first day at Hack Reactor, a small label was provided to label your power cord. Please don't take someone else's if yours is missing. Please don't take the ones belonging to Hack Reactor, or the ones labeled with the name of the space.
* **Visitors**: Your family is in town and they'd like to see the black hole into which you've disappeared? While a quick tour to show off what an amazing place we share is ok, longer periods of hanging out such as sitting in on lunch or a lecture are not allowed. Please email your campus's communication@ for clearance if you plan on doing so. 
* **Workstation Etiquette**:
  * **Do not touch the underside of the computers/workstations**: If you need anything adjusted, or have any specific needs, email your campus's communication@ with your request and they'll make sure it gets all sorted for you. Ask, don't touch. It will make life much easier for everyone.
  * **No open containers at the workstations**: We lose an amazing amount of equipment to careless liquid spills. Under no circumstances are open containers to be found by the workstations, at any time. This includes food and beverages in open cups.
  * **No food or eating at the pairing stations**: Keyboards get sticky and jammed, workstations littered, and food attracts flies. Liquids in closed containers are acceptable, but please consume all snacks and meals in the kitchen area.
  * **Judiciously change the workstation settings**: We want to maintain a consistent experience across the workstations so that student and Tech Mentor habits can be portable. Additionally, some workplaces will expect you to use a standard profile, this is a good chance to practice adapting to your environment. You should not change settings that are strictly personal preferences, however you should feel free to install or update tools that would otherwise block your progress on a sprint. For example, do not change the keyboard profile to Dvorak mode, however do use npm to install the latest version of node-inspector. If you feel a change would improve matters for everyone's productivity, or have any other concerns, email your campus's communication@.
  * **Computer Monitors**: Please, **do not** flex the monitor arms out from the desk. The monitors should be left in their original configuration. **Please turn off monitors after use.** Do not use them as shades for the sun, or force them out of the way to make room for your laptop. If you want to work on your laptop, use an open table instead.
  * **Files on the workstations are routinely deleted**: You should be using Git to save any work you're doing on the curriculum, and pushing that work to Github before going home. Any files found laying around the operating system will be automatically deleted from time to time. (Each student has one place on each workstation where they can keep files that will not be deleted, in the Desktop/STUDENT folder.)  Workstations are wiped any time the computer restarts and a restart is scheduled for 3am each day.
  * **Closing Applications**: Please shut down ALL applications before you leave at the end of the day so that workstations can restart as scheduled at 3am (This includes iTunes, App Store, Node.js)
  * **HackReactor Equipment**: Please, **do not** remove, swap, or change any cords, or other equipment from Hack Reactor computers, or staff/student desks. If you need something, please email your campus's communication@ and we will help you to the best of our abilities.
* **Conference Room**: In general, conference rooms are not available for student use.
* **Whiteboard House Rules**:
  - Use erasers to wipe off the small whiteboards: The carpet is not a reasonable alternative. You wouldn't wipe a whiteboard on your carpet at your relatives' house, and it's equally inappropriate here. Yes, this actually happened. I know, right? 
  - All whiteboards will be put away in their storage spot at the end of each day by the Space Ops team.
  - If you want to save your work, write "DO NOT ERASE" on the board in the upper right-hand corner.
  - Use large visible writing, this will ensure that Ops associates will not erase the board but simply put it away
  - Whiteboards will be found in the usual whiteboard supply area on your floor every morning.
  - Be courteous to other students and erase and replace whiteboards when you are done using them.
  - Whiteboards not actively in use will be wiped down each Saturday afternoon (this includes those with 'do not erase' tags on them)
  - Pro-tip: Really need the info? Take a photo of it to use for later.

### Orientation 5: The project phase
Read this orientation 1 week before you finish the academic sprints and start building your own projects. This list offers general information on what to expect from the project phase.

* **Front-End Capstone (FEC):** The first group project that begins after your junior sprints wrap up
* **System Design Capstone (SDC):** The second group project that begins during your senior phase.
* **MVP Project:** This is a solo project that occurs later in your senior phase. You will have a small window of time to create a Minimum Viable Product.

General components of the Capstone projects can be found below:

* **Amazing readmes**: In many ways, your readme and other software docs are actually more important to the health and impressiveness of your project than the code is. You will be expected to build your own readme for each of your projects. Amazing readmes include:
  * A description of your app.
  * A link to a deployed version.
  * Screenshots.
  * Your tech stack.
  * The challenges you faced.
  * A map of your codebase, and if appropriate, instructions on how to dive in and read the code.

* Refer to group project roadmaps that will be delivered by your Cohort Lead at the start of each project to find topics related to each week. This will allow you to stay on track for project deliverables.

* **Project Videos & Conversations:** During each group project period at Hack Reactor, you will have the opportunity to talk about your work in a video format to share your challenges and practice concise technical communication about your accomplishments for later reference  (such as when prepping for interviews). Your Cohort Lead will provide you with basic guidelines when it's time to create your videos. Here are some tips to prepare you for speaking about the applications you've built in job interviews.
  * Give a brief intro to your application - Since it's unlikely that people will use your product at a large scale and you won't generally get hired to build new products from scratch, just give a brief overview of what problem it solves. Keep this short since you are not presenting to investors.
  * **The Most Important Thing** - Frame your conversation as though you were talking about a recent project to an engineer at either a meetup or interview (i.e. *“...tell me about something you worked on recently”*). Talk about the interesting technical challenges you faced and how you solved them. 
  * Front-End Capstone (FEC) and System Design Capstone (SDC) videos should be about three minutes long.
  * Don’t spend hours working on the videos. If you’re rehearsing anything beyond sharing a few important technical challenges you've encountered, you’re trying too hard. That said, keep your audience in mind. This is your opportunity to showcase your engineering abilities, so consider  what would be interesting to an interviewer or in a Meet & Greet situation. This is also a great time to begin practice talking about how you could contribute to a team.
