## Women at Hack Reactor

The Women@ Hack Reactor community is a space for students, alumni, and staff from all campuses, who identify as women and/or gender non-binary, to share information, opportunities, and support. The community connects via the women@ e-list and HR-Women Slack team, as well as via in-person events. The Women@ Team typically hosts a dinner during Week 6/Week 12 of the program.

Please read the Women@ Intention Statement below to learn more about the community. More information on how to participate in the online community and events will be sent out via email during the Junior phase.

### Intention Statement

The tech industry is helping to pave the path for our future as a planet and the human race. The tech industry has a representation challenge that is hindering progression. Hack Reactor is committed to balancing the demographic landscape of coding bootcamps as well as the field of software engineering. One of our visions is to reach a 50/50 gender balance at Hack Reactor by 2020. 

There is a narrative born of ignorance that suggests men are more equipped to be software engineers than women. One way to shift public consciousness is by sharing stories and Hack Reactor is creating a path for people to tell their stories by its offering of Women@. In addition to changing representation, Hack Reactor is committed to supporting and holding space for our students, alumni, and staff from all campuses, who identify as women and/or gender non-binary. Women@ will be a safe space for this community to share their stories, ideas, fears, hopes, learn from guest speakers and each other, and experience support. Our hope is the participants of Women@ will inspire action from other women to seek out and embrace coding.

Women@ will meet during the 12th week of every cohort. We look forward to providing the following types of shared experiences: interactive discussions on current topics, alumni panels, guest speakers, practical workshops, and support for inspired action.

All participants are expected to treat each other with respect and dignity. Going against this expectation, could mean immediate removal from this community.
