## Software Engineer Immersive Resident Program

### Welcome Beautiful, Prospective SEIRs!


#### tl;dr

The Software Engineering Immersive Resident Program (SEIR) program is an alternate path for a small selection of seniors who want to share their talent with Hack Reactor before pursuing a full-time job. The difference? This time, Hack Reactor writes you the check.

The mission of the SEIR program is to dramatically increase your value as a software engineer by doubling the time you spend building upon your foundation, while you assist in increasing the value of those around you.

Past SEIRs have tripled the size of their portfolios, spent hundreds more hours teaching and discussing JavaScript, and helped select future students. As a result, their interview performance and value as software engineers have improved notably.

We look for passionate, curious engineers with a penchant for exploration and discovery, and students that contribute to this school's environment every day and are ardent about doing so in an official capacity.

### Position Requirements

The SEIR positions hold enormous accountability, as they interface with students from application-to-exit, in both technical, psycho-social, and cultural encounters. SEIR candidates are specifically selected for their technical, social, culture building, and autonomy skills. It is a core expectation of the job to be pleasant, display outstanding leadership and follower-ship, and judgment at all times. 

This is a high-ambiguity position. Specific roles that SEIR’s frequently fill include: 

  * Conducting technical interviews with applicants 
  * Staffing the Help Desk, serving current students
  * Delivering Toy Problem Solution Lectures at 9am daily 
  * Owning and executing energetic, cohesive daily kickoffs and evening presentations
  * Owning and executing energetic, appropriate, and well-received “social night” programming (including event closeup) 
  * Providing 1:1 technical support for current students, as requested

### Reporting & Pay

Reports to: SEIR Program Manager, Ife-Chudeni Oputa (Administrative Manager)

SEIR Daily Manager: Campus Lead - Rebecca Phares

Compensation: $26 /hour

Position Category: Part-time; non-exempt

### Required Documents

Please note that in order to be hired as an SEIR, you will need to present documents showing your eligibility to work in the United States. For a comprehensive list of acceptable documents, go to [this page](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents/list-documents/form-i-9-acceptable-documents). You will need to provide one item from List A, **or** two items: one item from List B **and** one from List C.

### Timeline

* Week 8 - SEIR Alumni Panel + Q/A Session for those curious about the program. Event details and SEIR Program applications will be emailed to seniors.
* Week 10 - The new SEIRs are selected and results are announced to seniors via email. Candidates will be notified prior to the senior announcement.
* Week 11 - SEIR Program & department orientation, training, and scheduling for incoming SEIRs.(approximately 10-25 hours).*
* Week 12 Day 1 - Official Start Date.

_*Incumbents are expected to be able to fulfill all of their System Design Capstone project accountabilities while conducting training sessions. This position requires outstanding time management, right out of the gate. Training will be paid time._

### Position Term
The position begins service on W12D1, and ends on W11D5, 3 months later. While staff who hold SEIR positions are legally free to depart the position at any time, we 100% expect and count on staff to fulfill the ENTIRE TERM they have signed up for, and it is a misapplication of expectations to vacate the position early.

### Scheduling

You're here because your ongoing pursuit of knowledge helps the students, and because helping the students benefits your ongoing pursuit of knowledge. There isn't too much of a distinction: if you're on your ideal path to learning, you're going to be an incredible asset to the students, no matter what.

There's also a lot of stuff that needs to reliably happen at the school on schedule, and we're going to depend on you for some portion of it. It includes:

* Interviews (technical + mocks)
* Help Desk shifts
* Toy Problem Solution Lectures
* Other SEIR roles are sometimes available with programs affiliated with HR

Staff strive to meet certain expectations regarding these responsibilities:

* You should be trained how to do this stuff, and you should feel really successful at it.
* We won't schedule anything during hours that we've set aside for SEIR activities (see below).

_**If we're failing at any of this, please tell the SEIR program Owner.**_

### How the Program Works

* For some SEIR roles, Asana will be your guide for specific tasks.
* You will have a schedule for your individual duties.


__Work Schedule__

Hackers In Residence conduct accountabilities throughout the operational hours of our program. Therefore, the scheduled hours may range from 9am -8:00p, Monday - Saturday, for staff assigned to the SFM program, and SEIRs are expected to be available for Saturday shifts. Frequently, this position will have a stabilized schedule term-to-term; however, flexibility in schedule is a core requirement of the position.

SEIR positions may have severely reduced hours during the Solo Weeks. Traditionally, the first Solo Week is a week “off” and the second one has reduced (but required) hours.

__Position Hours__ 

Specific working hours vary. HiR positions usually average ~29 hours per week, over the position term.


__Extra Time__

Unlike your life as a student, your hacking time will be *entirely self directed.* If you are considering applying to be an SEIR, the thought of this should ultimately excite you. Do you love the freedom and responsibility of autonomy or do you need the oversight and accountability of a superior? Are you able to motivate and excite yourself to be creative or do you need the constant praise and encouragement of another person? SEIRs must be willing and able to thrive on self-defined and self-directed work. If you are the kind of person who does not thrive with a great deal of freedom and autonomy, the SEIR program is not for you.

*Working on projects while you are an SEIR is highly recommended* and will allow you to boost your portfolio drastically.

Some Options:

  * Projects – Will function like the group project period during the course. Formulate an awesome idea with other SEIRs or by yourself, hack hard, and be proud of your project by the end of three weeks. If it’s awesome and you have a vision of how to take you project to the next level, continue for another period of three weeks.

  * Contract Work – Can be pursued as an individual or in a group. This is a good way to not only build a portfolio, but also earn extra $$. (Hack Reactor occasionally has word of contract opportunities, but you should expect to find your own contract work, which past SEIRs have certainly had success with. The SEIR Program Owner will inform you about any opportunities.)

#### Week Zero (Week 11 of your program as a student)

During this week you are still a student at Hack Reactor and will participate in all lectures, group project work, toy problems solutions, and other parts of student life.

There will be several on-boarding and training tasks you'll be asked to complete during this week.

1. Complete your Namely onboarding
  a. Provide verification indicating you are eligible to work in the United States. This is a necessary requirement to work as an SEIR. For acceptable documents see [this page](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/acceptable-documents/list-documents/form-i-9-acceptable-documents), keeping in mind that acceptable forms of documentation are as follows:
    * 1 item from List A
    * OR 2 items; 1 from each List B and List C
  b. Set up Direct Deposit
    * Bank account information is needed

2. Sign your employment contract
  * Will be sent to you via Namely by our People Department

3. Systems Onboarding
  * The majority of your systems onboarding will take place behind the scenes; however, there are a couple of things you'll need to do before you can attend your duties.
    * Set up your @hackreactor.com email address
    * Set up your Asana account (using the Google sign-in feature for your @galvanize email)
    * Accepting Github invitations to specific Hack Reactor @ Galvanize groups (these emails will be sent to the address noted in your Github account)

4. Welcome Orientation & Navigating Student Interactions
  a. Come prepared with questions and leave 99% clear on the 12 weeks of your life.
  b. Learn how to navigate the classroom as a staff member, and how to help students reach their full potential

5. Complete training for each of your roles

6. Complete the mandatory Sexual Harassment Prevention Training
  a. A link will be sent to you once you have completed your Namely onboarding

Your start date will be Week 12 Day 1.

### SEIR Roles

Your weekly hours will be allotted to one or more of the following roles.

##### Technical Interviewer

Help Admissions curate Hack Reactor's community by interviewing applicants and providing the Admissions team with feedback regarding applicants and the interview process.

Past technical interviewers have noted conducting interviews as SEIRs helped them in their own job search as they gained insight into what an interviewer looks for in a candidate.

##### HelpDesk

Help students get unstuck as they work through the curriculum. You'll encounter a plethora of new and interesting questions throughout your time working on HelpDesk and have the opportunity to support each student in developing a sense of autonomy.

##### Toy Problem Solution Lectures

Build up your own problem solving skills through mastery. Teach students valuable insights, how to solve various toy problems and empower students to think outside of the box.

### SEIR Specialized Roles

#### Shepherd - Lead SEIR
The Shepherd role is one of the highest value SEIR positions we offer. Shepherds serve as a dedicated pod team member, working at the direction of the Cohort or Campus Lead. Sheps MUST have willingness and ability to lead: 
  * Culturally (give kick a** evening kickoffs, step in at Toy Problems, resolve disagreements, inspire people to action, and demo our culture in all actions.)
  * Technically (can remediate student understanding or hold office hours). 
  * Must have discretion, outstanding time management, and ability to manage tasks and deliver precisely in the face of high ambiguity. 
  * Attend standups daily at 9:05-9:10am (zoom ok), and attend all pod tacticals. 
  * Must love people! And be a demonstrated “success” in our setting and profoundly balanced “people person”.
  * These positions are also considered full-time exempt w/ health benefits 

#### Precourse
 The Precourse SEIR is an incredibly high-value, high-autonomy position. Reporting daily to the team leading entry programming, the Precourse SEIR provides administrative, technical, and soft-skills leadership for all current precourse students. This position MUST demonstrate: 

  * Outstanding stand-alone leadership; maintaining and generating cultural adherence to, and enthusiasm for, our program for all involved students. 
  * Remarkable “people and program” judgment; providing technical and cultural course corrections to students, escalating difficult cases immediately to program leadership, and communicating our program boundaries and expectations regularly and as needed. 
  * Rock solid technical skills; providing technical guidance and growing students’ fundamental CS and JS capacities. 
  * Stable, reliable, spot-on communication; tracking students’ progress and reporting proactively to precourse leadership AND the upstream immersive, as directed. 


#### End of the program

You'll rejoin a class three months following yours during W12 (this includes W11D6 - Staging Day). You'll have the same outstanding Hack Reactor support for your job-search process. Depending on your specific role, you'll also help onboard the new SEIRs during the job search prep week.

#### Policies

* Harassment & Discrimination
  * Whether it be verbal, sexual, physical or cyber, harassment and discrimination are **unacceptable**.
  * Age is also a dimension of discrimination. Due to the nature of the tech industry, this can be sometimes forgotten. Please be careful how you speak about students and applicants as it pertains to these groups.
  * Note: the workplace extends to all social events you participate in with other employees or students, whether onsite or offsite (at a nearby bar, in any co-habitation, during conferences, during team social events).  The workplace also extends online to your social media outlets visible by coworkers and students. You are held accountable for any inappropriate behavior online as well.
* Harmful Jokes
  * regardless of intent, these comments are not acceptable in a professional environment.
* Drugs and Alcohol
  * Don’t be intoxicated at work or under the influence of anything illegal.
  * Take extra precautions to the effects of drinking with co-workers.
* Accountability
  * Be on time. If you can’t, email hir.owner@
  * If you’re going to be out for some reason, make sure your duties are covered and inform the SEIR program owner via email (ife-chudeni.oputa@galvanize.com)
  * Please avoid conflict of interest (refer to your contract).
* Overall Conduct
  * Don’t engage in any conduct that is not in the best interest of HR@G and yourself.


### FAQ  (Logistics, payment,etc)

#### Q. Am I staff or am I a student?

Both. You are primarily a student, but you will take on some staff-like duties. The SEIR Program is like a graduate fellowship where you have projects to deliver and responsibilities to uphold, but also have much knowledge to impart on current students and the improvement of Hack Reactor.

Legally, you are a part-time employee of Hack Reactor @ Galvanize. Your contribution to the students and the operation of the school (interviews, Hangouts, etc.) comprise the ‘staff’-like part of your role.

#### Q. What are you looking for in SEIRs?

Here are some traits we like to see:
* You have a willing attitude and are eager to help others.
* You love autonomy.
* You are looking to double-down on the material you learned in the course.
* You want to tackle topics you didn't get to learn in the course.
* You want to undertake a really big project.

#### Q. What support can I expect from staff?

* Administrative support from HR@G staff and the SEIR Program Owner.

**Halp!** – You can definitely use the help request system for your projects; we want you to get unstuck. Feel free to ask for guidance on project selection/direction, code reviews, feedback on talks you're developing, advice on how to contribute to open source projects, etc.

**Do NOT expect:**
**Three months of curriculum and tons of one-on-one mentorship** – You are in charge now. You have seen how the ship is run and it’s up to you to build and contribute to an SEIR team that fulfills your ideals.

**Micromanagement** – The SEIR program is fairly independent and the SEIR Program Owner is your primary ally in sorting out issues that arise. That aside, the Owner will not know your daily schedule and you are accountable for being successful in your project and school duties.

#### Q. How can I make extra money?

Some SEIRs have told us that they're unable to participate for financial reasons. We don't want financial concerns to limit access to the program, so here's the plan:

* Email the SEIR Program Owner this note when you apply to the program:

    "Hey! I'm interested in contract work opportunities." They will forward any opportunities to you and the rest of the SEIR Team.

* Do your best to find contract work independently.

#### Q. Do we get vacation (aka: my family thinks I’m dead)?

Incoming SEIRs are granted the Solo Week following their first official week as SEIRs off. Soon-to-be-senior SEIRs should plan on working over Solo Week.

**Do not schedule additional vacation** -- we can't afford to enter a painful world of boring record-keeping, awkward conversations, scrambled attempts to juggle responsibilities, and/or perceived unfairness.

#### Q. I feel sick, what do I do now?

If you're sick, don't come in. You are responsible for swapping duties with another SEIR; if that's not possible, please let us know in advance.

#### Q. How does this impact the job search?

You will re-integrate with the job search curriculum after your residency is over (W12D1).

Please do not begin a job search until then. Doing so is suboptimal for you (Hack Reactor’s job search curriculum is amazing and will improve your outcomes), and it distracts from your residency.

Under no circumstance should you take a job that starts before the last day of your residency. We don’t want you to leave early, as it takes time to train you and calendar your responsibilities.

#### Q. How does it work; do I have a manager?

Depending on the role(s) you are assigned as an SEIR, you may have multiple managers that oversee the portion of your residency that involves doing work for Hack Reactor.

Your position as an SEIR is ultimately at the discretion of the SEIR Program Owner.

You will not have a manager or any oversight for any projects you are working on, unless you are able through your efforts to make some sort of arrangements for oversight.

Of course for any sensitive issues that arise during your residency (personal status, desire to change job responsibilities, check in on performance, etc) - **We will totally support this to the extent we are able**. _You will have access to the SEIR Program Owner regarding any of the above._

#### Q. Can I work at other code teaching companies like AirPair or Thinkful?

No. Hack Reactor views these companies as competitors, and it would not be appropriate to be on our payroll and theirs during the SEIR program. If you are seeking extra income, please review the other FAQ questions that address this.

#### Q. Anything else I should know?

__Autonomy__

For many individuals, the SEIR program is a dream come true. Those who love autonomy and have a deep appreciation for the culture at Hack Reactor, look back on their time as SEIRs with incredible nostalgia and fondness. Like the rest of the staff at Hack Reactor, SEIRs must thrive on autonomy: it's just how we roll around here. Some people aren't as stoked as they might imagine to jump into a culture that values and requires so much autonomy. You should seriously reflect on both the benefits of residency in such a culture, and whether of not you're up for it personally.

__Willingness__

Be clear with yourself that you are willing to put in the time doing any of the possible roles you might be asked to fill. All of the positions have challenging aspects and at times can be downright hard. There's nothing special about this, and you can expect the highest level of respect for your work compared to about anywhere else you might ever work. Know that there is a component of work so you don't resent the hard days.

__Coding Time__

Although you will have time to hack on whatever you wish, it is absolutely certain you will not be coding as much as you were as a student at Hack Reactor. This is true of almost everyone graduating the program, but the contrast for SEIRs can seem especially sharp as you will still be surrounded by students. If you join the SEIR program, be prepared to transition away from being a student, which may come with some grief, in spite of the fact your will be transitioning into an incredible new role. Also, know that as an SEIR you will still have an *enviable* amount of time to hack away on whatever you wish.

__Honesty__

Should you apply, answer the prompts of the application honestly. We will be querying you on various topics in it that will allow us to know whether or not we will be able to provide you with an incredible experience as an SEIR. Even if the SEIR program is not a great fit for you, you can look forward to Hack Reactor's exemplary support for you going into the job hunt.

__Connections__

There are really incredible people at this school all of the time. SEIRs get to build deeper and more varied connections than the students only here for 3 months.

#### Q. How do I apply?

An email will go out a link to the application and job descriptionduring W8.  Please keep an eye out for that and note the due date so you can apply to be part of this amazing team!
