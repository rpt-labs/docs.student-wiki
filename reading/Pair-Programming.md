## Pair Programming

### Why do we love pair programming?

The point of pairing is not to learn about pair programming itself. Rather, the value is social: learning to communicate and work with others in a technical setting, which has major payoff in the workplace.

Working with other people who have different thought processes, expertise and skill levels is an invaluable experience, and is oftentimes of even higher value than the sprint content itself. Working alone does not let you leverage the social learning opportunities that are presented in pairing.
* Work closely with other people and personalities
* Understand other peoples' learning styles
* Learn how to teach and how to explain ideas, which will help in job interviews
* Share the feeling of doing something good: It is not about what you can do as an individual, but where you can go as a team.
**"Expertise is knowing the right path to the solutions. Mastery is knowing all the wrong paths too."**

In addition to completing the requirements of the sprint, another major point of the sprints is to learn how to approach problems while working with other people. Several pairs sharing what they learned over the course of a few weeks is better than everyone working alone.

**Try not to pair with the same person twice. You'll get more out of pairing with lots of different people.**

Note on soloing: If you are soloing for a sprint because your partner is absent or your cohort has an odd number of people, please communicate to the staff if you need any help.

### The Loop for Each Sprint

Beginning [after Explore the Problem]: Set the tone with your pair right away
  * I stay late / leave early
    * Can your pair continue to work after you leave? If so: What happens tomorrow?
  * Sometimes I need to… or I learn best when I…
    * Take time to think or research on my own
    * Whiteboard ideas
    * Talk through ideas
    * Show me the code!
* Bring each other up to speed
  * Read through the README together
  * What did you learn during the Explore the Problem?
  * How do you want to approach the assignment?

Middle [end of bare minimum requirements]: Check-in
  * Do we want to review any of the Bare Minimum Requirements or clean up our code before proceeding to the Advanced Content?

Close: Pair Feedback
  * Help your pair improve their workflow or programming style
  * What did they do well?
  * How can your pair be a more effective communicator?

### Optimizing Your Pair Programming Experience

* Proactively stop bad dynamics before they become prevalent in the experience.
* Are you being steamrollered or disrespected?
  * Say something
  * Assert yourself
  * Ask a staff member to mediate
* Tell your Counselor, Shepherd, or an available staff member if you feel the need to break off from your pair.
* You’re working with someone for an extended period of time, make it a good experience.
  * If the experience is obviously going badly, fix it.
* If you realize that you are contributing to a negative experience, take a step back and figure out a way to make the experience positive for both of you.
* Do you need a break? Take one.
  * Walk around
  * Power nap


### One Liners
* "Do you know what to do?"
* "I would love to understand this better; can we switch roles for this part?"
* "Would you be willing to explain what you did there? I don't quite feel confident I could do it on my own."
* "I am feeling a bit overwhelmed; do you mind if I step away for a few minutes?"
* "I'd like a few minutes to clear my head; let's take a 10 minute break."
* "I want to understand this topic before we dive in; do you mind if I take a few minutes to [ whiteboard, research ] on my own?"
* "Ah, I've got an idea! Mind if I explain on another tab in Sublime?"
* "I didn't quite understand that part, would you mind stepping through it with me?"
* "I feel like we haven't been equal in our driving / navigating roles, let's try to split up the work more evenly moving forward"
* "I'm sorry, I realized that I totally dominated that part. Feel free to tell me if I don't catch myself doing that."
