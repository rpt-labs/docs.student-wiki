#### <a name="purpose"></a> Purpose of The Mock Interview

At Hack Reactor, our mock interviews serve a handful of purposes in our educational model:

* Mocks give you an opportunity to practice your interviewing skills in a low pressure environment
* Mocks give you a chance to experience what an interview in the tech industry is like.
* Mocks provide us with an opportunity to give you feedback on your interview skills and check in on the progress you're making as a developer.

#### <a name="interview-quickref"></a> Interview Quick Ref

Your experience of a standard Mock at Hack Reactor loosely follows this timeline:

1. You'll get an interview request calendar invite.  It should include your name, a room, a time, a link to your resume, and an interviewer.
1. The interviewer won't waste much time before diving into [technical questions](#technical-questions) based on what you've told them about your background and goals.
  - You will likely get some feedback in real time.
1. [You are given feedback from the interviewer](#student-feedback).
1. Mock interviews are not to be rescheduled by the student unless there are circumstances outside of their control.

#### <a name="technical-questions"></a> Technical Questions

You'll be asked some technical question(s) in the interview.  The range of these can vary depending on your interest and what you claim you are expert at.  A few examples might be:

* Explain the architecture or a project you recently completed.  Be ready to talk through challenges you encountered and how they were resolved.  Be a teacher here.
* If you claim in your resume to know certain libraries well, it's reasonable that someone could ask you about those libraries.
* You should be able to answer obscure questions about Javascript.  You're a Javascript expert now. [This is a good guide.](http://bonsaiden.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/)
* Datastructures, datastructures, algorithms, datastructures.


#### <a name="good-practices"></a> Good Interview Practices

* Always talk out loud about your ideas--even when you're stuck.
* If the interviewer doesn't mind (and you should check) write pseudo-code instead of real code.
* If asked for real code, you *must* write syntactically correct real code.
* Never switch between real and pseudo code.
* Communicate clearly.
* Communicate kindly.
* Make eye contact when speaking or listening.
* Exhibit confidence.  If you are unsure, be confident about how unsure you are (Good: "It's not yet clear to me how we might achieve our goal here." Bad: "Umm, I'm stuck.")
* When asked to do things, take notes, so you can be clear you're doing the right thing.  Verify that you understand the question.  Verify that you understand what they want you to do.

#### <a name="interviewee-questions"></a> Your questions for your interviewer

We might not have time to quiz you on the questions you would normally ask an interviewer at the end of the process.  However, you should always have a few ready.  Before your interview think about some questions that you might ask.

Good Questions:

* Are open ended (Example: "Can you tell me about the role I would have here?" vs "Will I be on the engineering team here?")
* Help the interviewer know what the candidate values, such as an interest in good practices and systems, a strong culture, etc  ("Tell me about your release process.  How might you improve it?")
* Show that the candidate is going to consider many aspects of the job, not just salary, or a fancy office.

#### <a name="student-feedback"></a> Receiving Feedback

You will receive some feedback at the end of the interview.  Be sure you walk away with a clear idea of where the interviewer believes you could improve, and any suggestions they have for how you do that.  They may suggest some extra practice for you in some areas.
