## Playing the Role of the Interviewer

### You (yup you!) the Interviewer

Just when you thought you were getting ready to interview at a bunch of awesome companies, now it looks like you're the one with a job to offer! As a Senior you will have several opportunities to work on Toy Problems with your classmates on the whiteboard in preparation for onsite technical interviews. Often during those times you will be playing the role of the interviewer.

Interviewing can be really fun, and done well, can be a way both for you to improve your own problem solving skills and to support someone else in theirs. Here are a few guidelines to follow that will help you enjoy your time and support you and the interviewee's developing skill sets.

#### Be Respectful

Just because you have power, doesn't mean you have to be a jerk about it. Interviews (even ones conducted with your friends in mock) tend to bring out a lot of stress. Be considerate about this fact by interacting with your interviewee with the utmost amounts of respect and courtesy.

#### Keep the Sauce Secret

Which is to say, don't give away the answer. Not only does this prevent all the lovely brain exercising that could have been, but it just isn't fun, especially if you already knew the answer. The fact of the matter is that getting to the answer just isn't that important. It sure is satisfying, and worth celebrating, but technical interviews are meant to expose the ways in which people approach problems and communicate how they do it. You'll probably have to see it to believe it, but so many times an interviewee will not arrive at the answer, but will have been so clear and original in their approach that you can't help but feel how intelligent they were whether or not they got a solution. Solving the problem or not is an afterthought.

#### Ask for Clarification Frequently

This is your number one role as an interviewer. As the interviewee starts to work through the problem, it is your responsibility to hold them accountable for reasonably describing their thought processes. If they say something that doesn't line up with what they are doing, or say something that could have multiple interpretations, or say something that contradicts what they are doing or contradicts what they have already said, you should ask them to explain further or more clearly what it is they are trying to say. Sometimes this will involve reminding them of something they already said, or have on the white board, and explaining to them why you are feeling unclear about what they are saying.

This takes quite a lot of skill to do well, and you can expect to make improvements to your own thinking by practicing following closely what the interviewee is saying, and being able to interject in just the right ways and times.

#### Enjoy the Show (don't be controlling)

An easy mistake to make as an interviewer is to do too much. The fact of the matter is that for every individual, there will be a unique path of exploration that will lead to a solution to a problem, even if many of these paths are similar. It's pretty incredible to watch someone move from something unknown to something known, enjoy the show!

An especially difficult time to not be controlling is when the interviewee is not implementing a solution that you already know and enjoy. Challenge yourself as an interviewer to being open to paths of solution that you do not yet know. As long as the interviewee is making some sort of progress, and is articulating themselves clearly, it is probably safe just to sit back and watch what happens. That said...

#### Curtail Floundering

You will know when an interviewee is stumped entirely. There will be a quiet, and a tangible feeling in the room. In moments like these, you should intervene to get the dialogue moving again. Sometimes an interviewer will need reminding about what they had previously been up to so they can continue. Sometimes when they have arrived at a dead end they will need to be reminded of an earlier moment in their thought process to return to. Perhaps they mentioned an idea earlier that you can remind them about. If all else fails, you can ask them a specific question about the problem or their approach that you know will get them moving again, even if it wasn't their original question.


#### Leave Time for Followup

Make sure you leave some time at the end for both you and the interviewee to break role and just chit chat about the whole thing went. You can joke about the silliness of roleplaying and ask each other about how specific moments of interaction were for the other. It can be especially interesting to decompress about the stress involved if their was any. Realizing amongst your friends how unreasonably strong the stress is can be a great step in reducing the onset of it in future interactions.
