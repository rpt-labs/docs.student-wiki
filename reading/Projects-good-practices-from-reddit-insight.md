## Good Practices from Reddit Insights

Over their ~2 week group project period, the [Reddit Insight](http://www.redditinsight.com/) team (from our May 2013 cohort) got >100k visitors to their site and were covered by TechCrunch.

I did a Q&A with them to pull out what they felt were key success factors from both an execution and marketing perspective.

### So... how'd you do it?

Having shared goals among the team, coming up with a naturally viral idea, then dedicating & investing significant time to marketing and being persistent were the most important success factors for us overall.

### How did your success with Reddit Insight help with the job search process?

It gave us the extra boost we wanted - but at the same time, it was neither a golden ticket nor a critical dependency for us during the job search period.  Tons of our classmates also got awesome jobs doing other projects.

#### What it didn't help with:

* Inbound leads.  Even though we had >100k views and a “hire us” link, few people actually emailed us proactively with job opportunities.

#### Where it made a difference:

* Response rate and overall "hireability".  The applications we sent out had a really high response rate and the project never failed to pique interest during interviews.

### Did you feel you executed the project well?  What tips regarding execution do you have for other developers?

Definitely.  Good execution allowed us to build something awesome and get tons of exposure rapidly, as well as to quickly iterate as we received feedback.  The most important things, in our opinion, were:

#### Shared goals

* Have a frank discussion about the goals of each group member and allow people to opt out when things pivot.  Everyone needs to be excited about the project and be willing to put time into it.  We did well because everyone was really behind our idea.

#### Well-defined roles

* Have group members identify their strengths, weaknesses and development goals and decide on roles accordingly.

#### Project management
* Dedicate one team member as the project manager.  He / she should use a well-known tool to track tasks and assign tasks out to the team immediately after the standup (standups are only useful if you have actionable items coming out of them).  This is good for both execution and experience.  We used Pivotal Tracker.

#### Teamwork
* Hold team standups and establish goals for each person 1-2x a day.
* The entire team should work together physically.
* Use Git for workflow to avoid conflicts.

#### Dedicate plenty of time for polishing / marketing

* If PR / marketing is an important aspect of your project, allocate the first ½ of your project period to development and the second ½ as polishing/marketing (making it look good, getting the word out, iterating based on feedback, getting the word out, and getting the word out)

### Walk me through how you guys blew up from a marketing perspective.

The number of impressions we received over time roughly looked like this:

1. The first bump came when we posted on Reddit r/JavaScript with a poor landing page and a relatively poor title.  The traffic we got was disappointing and discouraging.
2. The second bump was better.  We posted it on Hacker News with a better title but still a poor landing page.  It resulted in around 20k visitors.
3. The big spike came after we completely revamped the landing page and posted on Reddit r/technology with a good title.
4. The small blip at the end was from our appearance on TechCrunch

### What'd you learn about getting exposure?

#### Think sharability when you come up with your idea.

* We made a conscious decision to pick something naturally viral and clearly useful for the user / consumer vs. potentially more groundbreaking but less sharable.

#### First impressions are critical.

* Title
 * Come up with a compelling title that intrigues but leaves the reading wanting more.
* Landing page
 * Super important.  You need to leave a quick and awesome first impression.  We learned the hard way.
* Ease of use
 * We asked people to try using the site without giving them any instructions and watched over their shoulder.  This was really insightful and caused us to change our UI a few times.
* Visual matters
 * People are visual creatures.
* Mobile ready
 * This caught us by surprise, but the Reddit community first tore us apart for not being mobile ready.  We wish we focused on mobile design from the beginning.
 * In short, make your project visible on all devices and look at it from a UX standpoint.

#### Be persistent

* Try, try and try again.
 * It took us days of dedicated effort to get our marketing results and multiple "small blips" before we hit a big one.
* Be prepared for the rule of large numbers.
 * For example, we engaged tons of people on Twitter before getting attention from influencers.  Targeting friends / colleagues of influncers can be a way to get their attention.
* Don't be shy with friends.
 * Go up to them physically to ask them to pull out their phone and upvote you.

#### Tread carefully with communities

* It's easy to get flagged.
 * Don't upvote using the same IP and avoid spam like activity.
* Some communities (e.g. Reddit r/JavaScript) can be vicious.  Watch out for those.
* Comment first in order to direct the conversation.
* Manage the conversation through replies so things don't spiral out of contract
* Set expectations.
 * People are a lot nicer when you're modest and let them know they're look at an early version of your work.
