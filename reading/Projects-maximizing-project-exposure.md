## Maximizing Project Exposure

Many students have found success in publicizing their projects.  This led to fantastic success in the job search, as you might imagine.  Below: our advice on how to replicate success.

### Launch ASAP.

If you don't launch before the project period ends, empirically, you probably won't launch.  If you plan to launch on the last day of the project period, empirically, you probably won't.  Make early deadlines and prioritize accordingly.  Cut all the features.  That big thing you're worrying about?  It's ok, just launch.

### Take 5m to add a "Tweet this" button somewhere

Should you get some traffic, it a) magnifies that traffic and b) provides a permanent, public-facing record of it.  (Proof.)[http://instahood.meteor.com/]

### If you get any attention

Talk to talk to us.  Often this enables us to get you press -- a note to a journalist saying "XYZ is blowing up" is 100x more interesting than one saying "XYZ might be interesting to you".

### Consider these venues:

* **Subreddits**.  There is definitely a subreddit that finds your thing interesting (or you are truly screwed), and reddit basically will reward you for emailing your friends and asking for help.  If you can't make this work, you're in hot soup.  Check out the [list of top subreddits](http://www.redditlist.com/) and find out how to fit with the vibe. r/technology is often a good one.  The main page is too general and r/javascript has a history of being brutal.  The title is really important - try something intriguing yet leaving the reader wanting more. Find the [best time to post](https://www.google.com/search?q=best+time+to+post+on+reddit). Be the first one to comment in order to set expectations and guide the discussion.  Reply to comments.
* **Hacker News**.  This is probably the second-best fit for most projects.  You probably can't get to the top without some friendly upvotes, and you probably can't do that without triggering the voting ring detection.  Talk to Ryan.
* **Other communities / message boards**.  There's probably some message board full of people that care more than either of the above two.  Maybe you know about it.  If not, take 5 minutes and see if you can find it.
* **Twitter**.  Hypothesis: there is a "famous" person that will tweet about your thing if you tweet/email them a friendly note.  Then you can say "XYZ tweeted about it" and gain minor street cred.  This is true because there is a functionally infinite number of "famous" people (eg "the creator of Meteor"), and most of them are flattered to hear from anyone treating them as such.  Let me know if you try this -- it's worked for me in various contexts.
* **Press**.  We have a PR team and may be able to help.  You can also try on your own -- it turns out that press people (esp those in industry rags like Mashable, etc) are readily available and hard-up for topics.  Make it easy for them -- make it so they can more or less write the story by copy-pasting your email.  Consider the "Former lawyer/farmer/chemist learns to code, writes law/farming/chemistry app in 3 months" approach -- people like that.  More details below.
* **Guest Blog Posts**.  You stand a good chance of getting on the guest blog of any company whose API you use.

### Pitching to press/blogs

* Caution: Pitching, getting a reply and finally getting something published can take lots of time.
* Keys to success: Use a brief email or twitter to make the ask.  Understand who you're pitching to, what is relevant to them and pitch something in line with their blog / readership.
