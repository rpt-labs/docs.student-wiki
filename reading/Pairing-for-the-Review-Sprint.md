## Pairing For the First Sprint

### Establishing Your Group

For the Review Sprint, you will have 3 different options, and will be paired with someone in your cohort embarking on the same course of action for the sprint as you. Use the following guidelines to determine which course of action you'll take for the sprint.

If during precourse you were able to make all the specs pass for both the recursion and underbar assignments and you feel confident you could do it again and you feel confident you could explain to an engineer just starting on the assignment, in a way that they would understand, how you solved each of the problems, you will be in the Mentor Group.

If you are not in the Mentor Group, but, you completed both the recursion and underbar assignments (making at least almost all the specs pass), and feel confident you could implement them again with very little support, you will be in the Autonomous Review Group.

Otherwise, if you believe you will need more than just a little support to reimplement them, you will be in the Collaborative Review Group.

### Your First Foray Into Pair Programming

At Hack Reactor you're going to get a lot of opportunities to build well formed opinions through experience before or without us telling you the right way. This first experience with Pair Programming is one such situation. You're going to get a lot more guideance around Pair Programming in the not-too-distant future, but for now, please explore what it is like for yourself, while respecting these minimalist guidelines:

  * One of you will the the "Driver" and will write the code, one of you will be the "Navigator" and will direct the "Driver" in what to write, sometimes very specifically, and sometimes more generally
  * You will switch roles from time to time
  * Do not Drive and Navigate at the same time (this is called steamrolling)
  * Make it a goal that you both understand what you're building, while moving as quickly as possible
