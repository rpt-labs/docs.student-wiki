## Post Interview Considerations

### Phone Screen Follow Up

It is important to ask for a timeline for the next steps when wrapping up a phone screen. This is something you really want to do for these reasons:
* It calibrates your expectations - and ours :) - for how fast a team will move
* The ask is a very polite and innocent way of indicating that you're watching the clock because you have a    lot of fast moving things, and therefore...
* It communicates a bunch of confidence, which as Marcus and Ryan both tell us, is the ultimate currency of the technical interview process.

Here are some suggestions for saying this after thanking someone for a call:
* "What are our next steps?"
* "When should I follow up about coming on site?"
* "What's our timeline moving forward?"
* "When will we know about next steps?"
* "What's our next move?"
Feel free to use a permutations algorithm or similar to make up your own version.

### In-Person Interviews

Follow up immediately with a brief "letter of thanks."  It's classy.
* If they assign a take-home project, include unit tests and documentation, especially if they don't ask for it. They're trying to trap you.
* Coordinate offers. Ask for time to consider one when you need it.
* Negotiate. Don't ever accept an offer without asking for a $10k bump. It's a very simple email to write (it can be as short as "Could you do $X+10?") and it's very effective. Don't feel bad, it's an established part of the hiring culture.
* Don't worry about the following:
    * Your title -- that changes easily.
    * Company size. Smaller companies give you broader experience, but bigger companies have more experts and more time to nurture you. It's a wash.

### Before the Interview

* At least one mock interview with Hack Reactor staff
* Google "glassdoor companyname interview questions".
* Review your toy problems

### During the Interview

* When you're not able to answer, remain calm and don't apologize.
* If you're asked a string of questions that are outside your skillset, recontextualize.
* Before leaving you must know:
    * Your role.  What kind of work will you do?
    * Team size.  You want to work with ~3-6 other developers.
    * How and when do they they ship code?
    * Their processes: How do they use git?  What's their testing stack?  What kind of code reviews do they do?
    * Many, many, many more questions in [this blog post](http://rebootjeff.github.io/blog/2014/01/09/questions-to-ask-dev-interviewers/) by the HR-VII alum who added this bullet point (shameless self-promotion)

## The Process for Applying

The default job application process involves wasting about 2/3 of your time paging through stuff and ambiently reading somewhat-relevant material that you won't act upon.  The key to optimal outcomes is to timebox your time-per-application and monitor your own progress, setting daily goals and checkins to maintain accountability.  You want a process that looks roughly like this:

* __(5 minutes)__ Page through your job list (eg craigslist, angel list, etc), spending ~1 minute per company assessing your fit for each company/role.  Of every 3-4 you look at, you should probably find one that you deem worthy of applying to.  (If that's not the case, talk to Shawn.)
* __(5 minutes)__ You'll now be at a resumator page or a blank email, assembling your materials.  It'll take you a couple of minutes to assemble your standard stuff -- resume, copy-pasted cover letter, links, etc.
* __(5 minutes)__ You want to customize your materials, but keep this within tight, tight bounds.  See "customize" above for details about what you want to edit.  You should be able to do this in a few minutes.

Set hourly and daily goals, and monitor them closely.  If you notice that you're reluctant to do this, or that you're not meeting your goals, raise alarms with staff and enter daily checkin mode.

## Tips for Applying to Jobs

**NOTE: Do NOT apply for jobs until instructed to by your Career Coach or the Career Search Team**

* Leverage your personal network as much as possible, people that know you or of you through a mutual friend are more helpful than strangers.
* Talk to people at meetups and be candid about your job search.
* Apply to a range of positions.  Spend about half your time applying for the jobs of your dreams, and the other half applying for the crappier jobs that are much easier to get.  It's nice to have a backup plan, and they're helpful in negotiations as well.
* Don't be discouraged at all by "4-year degree or equivalent experience".  That phrase means "don't apply if you don't know how to code".  Don't be discouraged by "2-3 years experience required".  More might be a problem.
* Don't be discouraged by "requirements" unless you're missing more than half of them.  They're more like "suggestions" and they're really flexible if you can communicate that the skills and experiences you do have indicate that you'll be able to pick up any language or framework easily.
* Apply to a lot of positions. A good goal to aim for is 100 jobs/month. The more jobs you apply to, the better the Career Search Team will be able to assess where your conversions aren't happening.
* Don't label yourself as a software developer or as a junior anything.  You're an engineer.
* Follow up within two working days of silence, unless you've already discussed next steps.  If they've missed a planned next step, email them within a day.  Use something like http://followup.cc/ to schedule this in advance.
* When you apply through a form, spend two minutes looking for an email address and follow up there as well.
* Don't judge a company too much before you apply.  You don't really know what it's like from the outside.
* Spend time customizing your cover letter for each company, but not too much.  You want to keep this time commitment down to a few minutes.
    * Reuse:
        * The overall structure.
        * Your description of yourself.
    * Customize:
        * The name of the position you're applying for.
        * One sentence about what you like about the company.
        * One sentence about what you like about the position, and something specific about how you'd do a great job at it.

### What to Do When You Get an Offer

* If they're delivering the message verbally, tell them that you're excited about the offer and the company and that you'll think it over and get back to them asap.
* Look at your pipeline, the list of companies where you have applied and heard back:
* If you got an offer from every one of these companies, which of them would be definite "no"s, compared to the offer you just got? Email those companies and tell them you're out of the running.
* You might be in a situation where there are only 1-2 other companies that are even close to the one that made the offer, but you feel like you might get more money from somewhere else. If that's the case, you should probably just negotiate a better offer. Contact your career coach and make a plan.
* If you would like to finish the job search, tell the offer company that you need X days. (They'll usually say that they want to hear back from you very quickly, but they probably not rescind an offer as long as X is 10 or less.) Then, contact all other companies in your pipeline and say "hey I got an offer and I need to get back to them in X days". This is great news for your pipeline -- they will all be very interested in you all of a sudden.
* Don't negotiate with the offer company until you intend to accept their offer. It's rude.


### Tips on how to select a job

* **Learn a lot**: The amount you learn is determined by two factors:
  * How much do you learn from your teammates? Consider:
    * How does the team do code reviews?
    * How good is their test coverage? This is generally an indicator of their professionalism.
    * How impressive were your potential direct team mates during the interview?
  * How much do you learn from the work? Consider:
    * What part of the stack are you responsible for?
    * How many major decisions will you be in charge of?
* **Get on a rocketship**: Join a company/organization that has already won, before everyone else has seen it.
* **Follow your heart**: You may want to join an edtech company, hack on bitcoin, or contribute to social causes.


### Your Biggest Job Search Enemies

* **Your Biggest Enemies are exhaustion, boredom, and emotional drain**: The job search -- especially at the application stage -- is fairly boring, rote work with high emotional costs. Every class, several people yield to their innate desire to avoid this kind of work. That's completely understandable, and if you find yourself in this situation, it doesn't indicate that you're failing... just that you don't naturally adapt to the (crappy) job of sending out applications. It's ok, and we'll help. Here're the steps:
  * Recognize that your emotional impulse is to avoid the job search process.
  * Recognize that those impulses aren't a manifestation of your real goals, and that you will need to override them.
  * Build systems that support your job search process. Set goals and check in daily with peers and staff.


## FAQ

### ToC

 * [What are my chances of getting a backend or full-stack role?](#backendjob)
 * [How should graduates talk about Hack Reactor?](#graduatestalkHR)
 * [When do graduates reveal that they went through HR in the job search process?](#revealHR)
 * [How should grads talk about HR in cities where we are not well known?](#HRaway)


### <a name="backendjob"></a>What are my chances of getting a backend or full-stack role?
Your odds are 10-25% or so for backend specifically, but it gets easier for your second job. Backend roles are much more difficult for our graduates to obtain than full-stack roles given that most companies want individuals with actual years of experience for that role. You will likely wind up with a front-end or full-stack role. Most JS jobs are front-end heavy and HR students are uniquely equipped with knowledge of the hottest front end frameworks, frequently the best job offers come for front end positions.  Make certain you're able to get one of those jobs as a backup plan.


### <a name="graduatestalkHR"></a>How should graduates talk about Hack Reactor?

This varies per student based off of prior experiences, and is something that they will go over during the hiring phase of the program.
First rule of job search is that you always only say things that help your chances of getting employed. If there's something you want to say, and you can't think of a way to make it increase your chances (even if it's neutral), you probably don't want to say it. You will hear more about this in the senior portion of the program.
You should talk about Hack Reactor as essentially a finishing school for software engineers, which uses JavaScript as a teaching language. True fact: By the time they come in, they already know JavaScript. At Hack Reactor, you spend a little time mastering JS and CS fundamentals, but then spend most of your time just building cool things with really awesome people (see awesome Github + project links on website/resume etc).


### <a name="revealHR"></a>When do graduates reveal that they went through HR in the job search process?

In a nutshell, the only times that you should bring up Hack Reactor are at times when it would impress an employer. Unless the company knows us, you first want to impress them in a bunch of other ways.
When you reveal that you went through hr is governed by the first rule of job search. You reveal it when it would be most useful to you to do so. Examples:
- If you're interviewing at a company like Change.org, Docusign or OpenTable, the best time to tell them is yesterday, as they are in love with all the grads they've ever hired.
- If you're interviewing with a company that hasn't heard of us, it's usually best to first convince them you are a badass, before you draw any attention to how much of your knowledge you picked up in just 12 weeks
- HR can come up contextually in response to questions employers might ask like "what got you interested in n-queens?", "how did your project team come together?", "why did you rewrite underscore?" or "how do you know so much about JS instantiation patterns?"

### <a name="HRaway"></a>How should grads talk about HR in cities where we are not well known?

Revert to first rule of job search. If we're not well known, a graduate needs to sell themselves on the merits of their projects, skills, Github, portfolio, blog and how they present themselves personally, rather than trying to introduce and explain to people the concept of an immersion school.
