## Resume Troubleshooting

You just received your resume rating and you want to know how to go from good to great. We see a couple different issues when it comes to resumes, which are explained below.

If your resume is green, you are generally good to go, but need to tweak one or two things:
* check your formatting, things might be cluttered or inconsistent
* make sure you have no typos
* there is too much space at the top of your resume and too little at the bottom. Center your content so that the space on the top and bottom is equal on both sides.


If your resume is yellow, you likely have one the following issues:
* your resume needs better content
* your resume is poorly formatted
* your resume looks weak overall
* you are not balancing your project experience and your professional experience

If your resume is red, you probably have all of the above issues. Very few people receive a red rating, so by putting in a little bit more work into your resume, you will be able to resolve them with ease. Ask your peers for help!


### Formatting

Formatting is a bigger deal in resumes than you think. If your resume is poorly formatted, recruiters will dismiss it upon first glance. It's equivalent to going to a website that is poorly designed and clicking out immediately, regardless of how important the content is because the experience of looking through it is so bad. Let's take a look at some examples. For these examples, ignore the content in the first version of the resume, and focus only on formatting.

In the example below, the first resume is very hard to look at. Tole has underlined too many things, which is distracting and make things look cluttered. There are also no spaces between his different projects, which is difficult on the eyes.

After he finished editing it, it was very easy to look at upon first glance. A good way to test your formatting is to walk up to someone who has never seen your resume, show it to them, and watch how they respond.

In this second example, Brian's "before" format is incredibly distracting. There are four colors on his resume between his headers, links, and text. In the "after" format, Brian's text is black only and he uses bold, italics, and underlines to denote the flow of information. It's an incredibly clean and beautiful resume.

### Balancing your Professional Experience with your Project Experience

The software engineering related things on your resume should take up ~60% of your resume. This is because you are trying to get a job as a software engineer. Anything else will send mixed messages to employers about what kind of opportunities you're looking for.

### Weak Resumes

Resumes with little content look incredibly weak and are easily discarded by recruiters. Some people confuse a lack of content for "cleanliness" but this is not the case. Instead, it looks as though you did not put a lot of time into it, and is not a direct reflection of what you actually did. To flesh out your bullets, ask yourself the questions: "What did I do?" "How did I do it?" "What results came out of my actions?" - if you write a bullet to answer these three questions, your resume will be strong, clear, and compelling.
