## Blogging

Writing blog posts and journaling online about your experiences here at Hack Reactor is easy and [quite valuable to you as a software engineer](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/10/the-one-thing-every-software-engineer-should-know.html). While writing a technical blog is not a requirement of the program, it is never too early to begin to establish your online presence.

A former tech mentor created a [guide](http://blog.sunnyg.io/2015/09/24/ghost-with-github/) for setting up a free blog on Github Pages with the Ghost blogging platform. This is one of the easiest ways to set up and maintain a blog!

If you want to write blog posts about your work on any of the sprints, do not simply make your repo public. Instead read about how to use our Hack Reactor repo publication tool [Liberator](https://github.com/hackreactor/liberator). You must use [Liberator](https://github.com/hackreactor/liberator) to publish your work.


#### Ideas For Blog Posts!

**Solving a very specific problem** - If you got stuck, googled it, and couldn't find it. Then write what you figured out when you solved it. If you're intimidated by the idea that it's too trivial or reveals a lack of knowledge, run it by a peer or instructor.

**Referencing a resource that helped you solve a problem indirectly** - If another person's post or work helped you figure out a problem, quote the most helpful bit and add a paragraph of context about how it applied to your specific problem.

**Collecting a set of links that helped you solve a problem** - Similar to the version above, but aggregate several links and posts that came together to solve a problem.

**Review a library or module** - If you ran across a less used library or module that fixed a particular problem, just write a couple lines about how it helped and what you recommend it for. To make it look nice, quote the library's own description.

**Curate a list of libraries or modules that combine to solve a need or problem** - This can be really easy. Just do some links with a sentence description for each.

**Compare/contrast libraries or modules that solve a specific problem** - Similar to the above, but just offer a line of review about the pros/cons of a set of solutions that do the same thing.

**Explore a new tool you're evaluating** - Write up a quick paragraph of the problem you're trying to solve and why you're considering the tool. Write another graph about the tool and what it does. Pull together several quotes from blogger's and experts in the space that give a well-rounded picture of the tool in practice. Could be positives as well as potential pitfalls. Close off by promising a review after you use it.

**Stack review** - Do a post-project review of a stack you used. What were the positives? What were the drawbacks? What tools would you have used instead if you did it again?

**Document playing around with a tool** - If you just got into D3, for example, and tried three or four different visualizations, grab a photo of each and just post examples of what you're finding out you can do with it.

**Inspiration post** - This could be a real copout, but just grab screens of apps that inspire you when it comes to the tech or design of your current project or some problem you want to explore. Just add a sentence or two why you like each one.

**Cool things being made with a tool you're considering** - Similar to above, but in the context of telling people about the potential of a new tool you're starting to use. Ex: "Examples of RTC in action," "D3 graphs that go beyond the built-in layouts."

**Feedback follow-up** - Any feedback you get on a project or any updates you do are an easy post. Just post the feedback with some context and then link back to original posts that covered that thing.
